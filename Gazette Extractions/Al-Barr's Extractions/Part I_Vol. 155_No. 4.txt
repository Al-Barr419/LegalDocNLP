CANADA BORDER SERVICES AGENCY
SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT
Certain oil country tubular goods â€” Decision
On September 28, 2021, pursuant to subsection 39(1) of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) extended the preliminary phase of the investigation into the alleged injurious dumping of certain oil country tubular goods from Austria.

SIMA provides that, under normal circumstances, the preliminary stage of the investigation shall be completed within 90 days of the date of initiation. However, due to the existence of circumstances that make it unusually difficult to decide within 90 days whether to make a preliminary determination of dumping or to terminate the investigation with respect to some or all of the goods, the period has been extended to 135 days, pursuant to subsection 39(1) of SIMA.

Consequently, the decision to issue a preliminary determination of dumping or to terminate the investigation with respect to some or all of the goods will be made on or before November 19, 2021.
