CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL
DETERMINATION
Shipboard miscellaneous equipment — Repair, overhaul, modification and calibration

Notice is hereby given that, after completing its inquiry, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal made a determination (File No. PR-2021-034) on December 23, 2021, with respect to a complaint filed by Marine Recycling Corporation (MRC) of Port Colborne, Ontario, pursuant to subsection 30.11(1) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 47 (4th Supp.), concerning a procurement (Solicitation No. F7044-200238/A) by the Department of Public Works and Government Services (PWGSC) on behalf of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The solicitation was for the disposal of the former vessel CCGS W.E. Ricker.

MRC alleged that PWGSC relied on undisclosed criteria in the evaluation of the bid, failed to apply published evaluation criteria and ignored vital information contained in the bid.

Having examined the evidence presented by the parties and considered the provisions of various trade agreements, the Tribunal determined that the complaint was not valid.

Further information may be obtained from the Registry, 613‑993‑3595 (telephone), citt-tcce@tribunal.gc.ca (email).
