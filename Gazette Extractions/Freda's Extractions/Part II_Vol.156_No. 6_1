REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS STATEMENT
(This statement is not part of the Regulations.)

Issues
The need for a number of minor technical amendments to the regulations has been identified with the introduction of a new statutory holiday. Under subsection 78(1) of the Patent Act, where a time period for doing anything ends on a prescribed day or on a day designated by the Commissioner of Patents, the time period is extended to the next day that is not a prescribed day or a designated day. The prescribed days for the purpose of subsection 78(1) of the Patent Act are listed in section 5 of the Patent Rules. The equivalent provisions, pursuant to subsection 66(1) of the Trademarks Act and subsection 21(1) of the Industrial Design Act, appear in the Trademarks Regulations and the Industrial Design Regulations, respectively.

The Patent Rules, the Trademarks Regulations and the Industrial Design Regulations, as currently drafted, do not include the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation observed on September 30 as a day for which the Canadian Intellectual Property Office is closed and deadlines are automatically extended. Without amendments to these regulations, the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation will be the only statutory holiday not identified. As the Office would be officially closed on September 30, this could potentially cause confusion to stakeholders due to the day not being listed.

Minor amendments to paragraphs 5(c), (g), (h) and (l) of the English version of the Patent Rules are also being made to correct errors in grammatical structure.

Objective
The amendments have the following objectives:

to harmonize terms used in the regulations with those used in the enabling statute or related regulations; and
to add clarity to a regulatory provision.
Description and rationale
The proposed amendments to the regulations will

introduce the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to section 5 of the Patent Rules;
introduce the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to section 15 of the Trademarks Regulations;
introduce the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to section 36 of the Industrial Design Regulations; and
correct the comma placement in paragraphs 5(c), (g), (h) and (l) of the English version of the Patent Rules.
One-for-one rule and small business lens
The one-for-one rule does not apply to these amendments, as there is no change in administrative costs or burden to businesses.

Analysis under the small business lens determined that the amendments will not impact small businesses in Canada.
