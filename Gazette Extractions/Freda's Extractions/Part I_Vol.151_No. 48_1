8. This part applies to the loading and unloading of oil within WCMRC's Geographic Area of Response (GAR).

9. In relation to an arrangement with WCMRC, the total BOCF payable by a prescribed oil handling facility shall be determined by multiplying the total number of tonnes of bulk oil unloaded (and in the case of bulk oil intended for international destinations and destinations north of 60° north latitude loaded at the prescribed oil handling facility) by the BOCF per tonne for each type of oil set out in sections 11 and 12 of this Part.

(c) by dividing the forecast annual Funds Required for Capital Purchases (1) of WCMRC, plus the provision for tax (2) by the forecast Annual Volume (3) of bulk oil cargo to be loaded or unloaded within WCMRC's GAR (4);

(e) Provision for tax (2) = (Funds Required for Capital Purchases less amortization of capital assets purchased previously with the BOCF) multiplied by the applicable rate of tax;
(f) Annual Volume (3) = Total volume of bulk oil cargo unloaded plus total volume of bulk oil loaded for international destinations and north of 60° north latitude within WCMRC's GAR and, where applicable, bulk oil cargo transferred between ships within WCMRC's GAR; and
(g) GAR (4) = Geographic Area of Response for which WCMRC is certified to operate.
15. The CALFR calculated by the above formula is applicable to all products except asphalt. The CALFR for asphalt is 50% of the rate for all other products.
