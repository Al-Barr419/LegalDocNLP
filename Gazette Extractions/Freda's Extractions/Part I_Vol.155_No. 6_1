These Instructions are published in the Canada Gazette, in accordance with subsection 87.3(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.

These Instructions are given, pursuant to section 87.3 and subsections 92(1.1) and (2) by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration as, in the opinion of the Minister, these Instructions will best support the attainment of the immigration goals established by the Government of Canada.

These Instructions are consistent with the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act objectives, as laid out in section 3.

Authority for these Ministerial Instructions is pursuant to section 87.3 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Instructions are directed to officers who are charged with handling and/or reviewing certain applications for temporary resident visas, work permits and study permits, by establishing conditions that must be met before the processing of an application or request.

Considerations
Recognizing the declaration by the World Health Organization regarding the pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus);

Recognizing how the related response measures have reduced Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada's capacity for processing applications, both in Canada and overseas; and

The following foreign nationals who are outside Canada and submitting applications for temporary resident visas, work permits, and study permits may submit these applications by any other means that is made available or specified by the Minister for that purpose:

Foreign nationals who, because of a disability are unable to meet a requirement to make an application, submit any document or provide a signature or information using electronic means;
Foreign nationals who hold an identity or travel document described in paragraph 52(1)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations that was issued by a country, that does not prohibit travel to Canada, that the foreign national may use to enter the country of issue and that is of the type issued by that country to non-national residents, refugees or stateless persons who are unable to obtain a passport or other travel document from their country of citizenship or nationality or who have no country of citizenship or nationality; and
