DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999
Notice of intent to inform stakeholders of upcoming consultations on proposed changes to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program
Purpose of this notice
Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is proposing to conduct consultation activities in 2017 in relation to proposed changes to its facility Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Program (GHGRP). Specifically, the Department is proposing to amend the reporting requirements under this program to gather additional information on facility GHG emissions.

These changes are part of the Department's efforts to better inform Canada's national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory by directly incorporating facility-level emissions data to improve precision and consistency in national and provincial-level inventory estimates and to more accurately identify causes of changes in facility emissions. ECCC will work collaboratively with provinces and territories to further develop a harmonized and efficient reporting approach.

Stakeholders will be invited to provide comments on the expanded reporting requirements under the GHGRP. Information obtained during consultations will be used to tailor the expansion approach as well as inform the development of reporting requirements and future decisions on which sectors or activities should be included in the various phases of the expansion.

Background
In 2004, the Government of Canada initiated a mandatory GHG reporting program (GHGRP), which requires facilities to report their GHG emissions annually, through the publication of annual notices under section 46 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA). The program currently targets operators of facilities emitting 50 kilotonnes (kt) or more in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq.) units (mostly large industrial operations) and sets out basic reporting requirements. The GHGRP annually publishes the collected data in aggregated format, in keeping with the provisions set out in sections 49 to 53 of CEPA.

Lowering the reporting threshold
Starting with data to be reported in 2018 for the 2017 calendar year, ECCC is proposing to lower the reporting threshold for all facilities from 50 kt CO2 eq. to 10 kt CO2 eq. This change will lead to an enhanced understanding of industrial emission levels in Canada and provide improved coverage of certain industry sectors to support integration into the national GHG inventory through a bottom-up approach. It is also intended to better align the GHGRP with provincial GHG reporting programs in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.

Requirement for additional detailed data for selected sectors and activities
ECCC is also proposing to require facilities to report additional information, aligning requirements with provincial reporting regimes where possible. Currently, information is missing that would allow ECCC to separate the facility emissions by specific sources or activities, allocate the data to internationally agreed reporting categories, and describe emission quantifications as required by international reporting guidelines. The additional information will enable the integration of facility data directly into the national GHG inventory, and enhance consistency among provincial and federal GHG inventories.

This proposed expansion would occur in phases, each phase covering several industrial sectors at a time. For the first phase, ECCC is aiming to introduce the additional reporting requirements for a number of specified industries and activities in a notice to be published in Part I of the Canada Gazette in 2017 (i.e. starting with 2017 calendar year data to be reported in 2018). Notwithstanding the change in threshold, the current reporting requirements specified in the annual notice for all other types of facilities subject to these reporting requirements would be maintained.

Phase I:

— Cement production
— Lime production
— Iron and steel production
— Aluminum production
— Petroleum refining
— Carbon capture and geological storage
— Electricity generation
Phases II and III:

— To be determined
To reduce the reporting burden, ECCC would seek, to the extent possible, to align the additional reporting requirements with those of the three provinces collecting facility data consistent with the requirements under the Western Climate Initiative, namely, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.

Reporting mechanism
Reporting requirements on GHG emissions would continue to be collected via ECCC's Single Window system. The ECCC Single Window system currently collects data for the GHGRP and for British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and New Brunswick, to support provincial GHG reporting regulations; the National Pollutant Release Inventory and its partners; and various other partner programs. The use of a single system for reporting GHG emissions helps to reduce the reporting burden on industry, as well as the overall cost to governments.

Next steps
Consultation on the proposed changes is planned to begin in winter 2017. Further details will be released prior to the consultation period to provide information on the intended approach and the associated timelines.

As a first step in the engagement process, interested parties should submit their contact information to ECCC before January 9, 2017, so they may be included on the distribution list to receive updates on the proposed amendments to the program.
