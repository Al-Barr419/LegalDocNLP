In relation to the substance aluminate (AlO21-), magnesium (2:1), a significant new activity is any use where the substance is engineered to contain particles of particle size ranging from 1 to 100 nanometres in one or more dimensions, in a quantity greater than 10 kg in any one calendar year.
The following information must be provided to the Minister at least 90 days before the commencement of each proposed significant new activity:
(a) a description of the significant new activity in relation to the substance;
(b) if the substance is used in consumer products as defined in section 2 of the Canada Consumer Products Safety Act,
(i) the information specified in Schedule 5 to the New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers),
(ii) the analytical information to determine the primary and secondary particle size of the substance,
(iii) the information describing the agglomeration and aggregation state, shape, surface area and surface charge of the substance,
(iv) the analytical information to determine the primary and secondary particle size of the test substance as administered in the health and ecological toxicity tests required under subparagraph (i), and
(v) the information describing the agglomeration and aggregation state, shape, surface area and surface charge of the test substance as administered in the health and ecological toxicity tests required under subparagraph (i);
(c) in all other cases, the information specified in Schedule 4 to those Regulations;
(d) the anticipated annual quantity of the substance to be used in relation to the significant new activity;
(e) if known, the three sites in Canada where the greatest quantity of the substance, in relation to the significant new activity, is anticipated to be used or processed and the estimated quantity by site;
(f) the identification of the other government agencies, either outside or within Canada, that the person proposing the significant new activity has notified the use of the substance and, if known, the agency's file number, the outcome of the assessment and, if any, the risk management actions in relation to the substance imposed by those agencies; and
(g) all other information or test data in respect of the substance that are in the possession of the person proposing the significant new activity, or to which they have access, and that are relevant to determining whether the substance is toxic or capable of becoming toxic.
The above information will be assessed within 90 days after the day on which it is received by the Minister.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This explanatory note is not part of the Significant New Activity Notice.)

A Significant New Activity Notice is a legal instrument issued by the Minister of the Environment pursuant to section 85 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999. The Significant New Activity Notice sets out the appropriate information that must be provided to the Minister for assessment prior to the commencement of a new activity as described in the Notice.

Substances that are not listed on the Domestic Substances List can be manufactured or imported only by the person who has met the requirements set out in section 81 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999. Under section 86 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, in circumstances where a Significant New Activity Notice is issued for a new substance, it is the responsibility of every person who transfers the physical possession or control of the substance to notify all persons to whom the possession or control is transferred of the obligation to comply with the Significant New Activity Notice and of the obligation to notify the Minister of the Environment of any new activity and all other information as described in the Notice. It is the responsibility of the users of the substance to be aware of and comply with the Significant New Activity Notice and to submit a Significant New Activity notification to the Minister prior to the commencement of a significant new activity associated with the substance. However, as mentioned in subsection 81(6) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, a Significant New Activity notification is not required when the proposed new activity is regulated under an act or regulations listed on Schedule 2 to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999.

A Significant New Activity Notice does not constitute an endorsement from Environment Canada or the Government of Canada of the substance to which it relates, or an exemption from any other laws or regulations that are in force in Canada and that may apply to this substance or activities involving the substance.
