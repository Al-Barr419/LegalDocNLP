REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS STATEMENT
(This statement is not part of the Regulations.)

Issues
The Canadian Pari-Mutuel Agency (CPMA) regulates and monitors pari-mutuel betting in Canada on horse racing. Section 204 of the Criminal Code is the legislative authority by which the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food may make regulations in respect of pari-mutuel betting (Pari-Mutuel Betting Supervision Regulations, the Regulations). The CPMA uses this regulatory framework to ensure the integrity of pari-mutuel betting systems in Canada. The objective of the CPMA is to establish compliance with the Regulations in an efficient and effective manner, thereby protecting the interest of the betting public.

The Regulations were amended extensively in August 2011. Since then, the CPMA has further reviewed the Regulations and identified additional changes that would enhance the predictable operation of authorized pari-mutuel betting systems. In addition, a number of the proposed changes will reduce the administrative and regulatory burden on industry, consistent with the Government of Canada's Red Tape Reduction Action Plan.

The CPMA has also proposed that a drug be added to the schedule of drugs under the advice of the Federal Drug Advisory Committee. Quantitative limits for cobalt would be added to section 2 of the schedule to the Regulations.

Finally, the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations (SJCSR) has identified a number of instances where changes would resolve discrepancies between the English and French versions.

Objectives
The proposed changes have benefited from internal review and broad industry consultation. They would help ensure that a modern approach to regulatory oversight is being delivered by the CPMA, and that the objectives of the horse racing industry are being advanced without compromising the integrity expected by the betting public. These changes would also help ensure that an effective barrier is maintained to discourage those who would attempt to influence the outcome of a horse race by administering drugs or medicaments to horses.
Description
The CPMA has identified a number of changes to the Regulations that would help ensure a relevant and comprehensive regulatory framework for supervising the conduct of pari-mutuel betting in Canada on horse racing. Proposed regulatory amendments include the following:

Extending the duration for which betting permits and betting theatre licences may be issued, for up to three years;
Clarifying the betting information that race-course associations must make available to the betting public;
Identifying a secondary source for exchange rates so that bets made in less common currencies may be converted to Canadian dollars and comingled in Canadian hosted betting pools;
Opening betting accounts in provinces that do not conduct horse racing;
Establishing requirements for conducting separate pool betting;
Clarifying the requirements for the CPMA's Equine Drug Control Program;
Making changes that address inconsistencies in the French and English versions of the Regulations;
Repealing the regulation that allows Standardbred Canada and the United States Trotting Association to fulfill certain responsibilities related to the conduct of pari-mutuel betting in a province that has not otherwise established an organization to regulate horse racing; and
Adding the drug cobalt to section 2 of the schedule to the Regulations.
“One-for-One” Rule
The “One-for-One” Rule does not apply to this proposal, as the regulatory amendments would not impose any administrative burden on business.
Small business lens
The small business lens does not apply to this proposal, as the proposed regulatory amendments would not impose any costs on small business.
Consultation
In September 2014, the CPMA met with Racetracks Canada and provincial regulatory bodies to discuss the proposals for updating the Regulations. The CPMA also made available online a discussion document from September 17, 2014, to October 17, 2014, to encourage feedback from the Canadian public and other stakeholders on the proposed regulatory amendments.

The CPMA also consulted with the Federal Drug Advisory Committee, which is composed of veterinarians, pharmacologists and chemists, when proposing to add the drug cobalt to the schedule. The Committee supports this regulatory action.

Rationale
These changes are primarily administrative in nature and would advance the Government of Canada's Red Tape Reduction Action Plan. The changes include extending the current one-year duration for which all CPMA-issued authorizations remain valid. Multi-year approvals would significantly reduce the administrative burden on race-course associations seeking approval to conduct pari-mutuel betting.

Drugs and medications administered to race horses could affect the outcome of a pari-mutuel race. Drugs that are veterinary medications approved for sale in Canada may be administered to a horse but, with few exceptions, including vitamins and some anti-parasitic and antimicrobial agents, must not be present in a horse's system when it races.

Compliance with the CPMA's Equine Drug Control Program is accomplished by testing post-race samples of urine or blood taken from race horses. Positive results are reported to the provincial regulatory bodies for appropriate action under their Rules of Racing. The addition of cobalt to the schedule will be positive because the prohibition of potentially performance-altering drugs and substances will continue to protect the bettor and the integrity of the racing industry. Stakeholders have been advised of the pending addition of cobalt to the schedule.

Implementation, enforcement and service standards
The proposed Regulations would not require any new mechanisms to ensure compliance and enforcement.

The CPMA is adjusting its existing supervisory activities as it moves toward a risk management approach to overseeing authorized betting activity. This includes reliance on remote monitoring and on-site inspections by the CPMA's officers and the use of an independent, automated auditing system that helps establish that licensed pari-mutuel operators continue to comply with all regulations.

There are no costs or environmental impacts associated with this regulatory amendment. No additional resources are required to implement the amendments.

The amendments will take effect on the day on which they are registered.
