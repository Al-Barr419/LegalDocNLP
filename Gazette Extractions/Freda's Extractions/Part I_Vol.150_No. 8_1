AND WHEREAS Canada and Saskatchewan agree that Saskatchewan, due to its existing relationship with owners and operators of municipally, privately and provincially owned wastewater systems, is well positioned to act as the point of contact for the administration of the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations;

AND WHEREAS section 4.1 of the Fisheries Act and the Order Designating the Minister of the Environment as the Minister Responsible for the Administration and Enforcement of Subsections 36(3) to (6) of the Fisheries Act enable the Minister of the Environment to enter into agreements with a province to further the purposes of the Act, including facilitating joint action in areas of common interest, reducing overlap and harmonizing respective programs;
