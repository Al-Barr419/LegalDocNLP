FOOD AND DRUGS ACT
Notice to interested parties — Marketing Authorization for maximum residue limits for veterinary drugs
Recent updates to the Food and Drugs Act that were introduced in sections 30.2 to 30.4 as part of the Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act of 2012 (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/J-0.8.pdf) give the Minister of Health the authority to issue Marketing Authorizations and incorporate documents by reference. The Department of Health is publishing a Marketing Authorization (MA) for veterinary drug maximum residue limits (MRL) in order to realize the efficiencies from this legislation and improve current processes.

A maximum residue limit (MRL) is an amount of drug residue that — if present in the tissue of a food animal or a food product derived from a food-producing animal that has been treated with a veterinary drug — will not pose an unacceptable risk to the safety of the food. This residue, at this level, is considered to pose no adverse health effects if ingested daily by humans over a lifetime. Currently, when Health Canada reviews and authorizes a veterinary drug for sale in Canada, an MRL for the drug residue is determined at the same time; however, the MRL then has to be added to the regulations, which can take many years after the scientific decision and consultation have already taken place.

As a result of this new legislation, an MA has been prepared to modernize this process in Canada in a way that maintains the scientific rigor and consultation process, but removes the step of making a regulatory amendment for each new or updated MRL. Health Canada's new MA process for veterinary drug MRLs will continue to protect the health and safety of Canadians while also reducing unnecessary red tape. The new process will be several steps shorter and less labour intensive because the regulations do not need to be changed every time an MRL is established or updated. Instead, the “List of Maximum Residue Limits for Veterinary Drugs” will be incorporated by reference (i.e. have the force of law) and will be maintained on Health Canada's Web site; any proposed changes will continue to be the subject of consultation, and the list will then be updated administratively. Associated Governor in Council regulations are being developed for pre-publication at a later date in order to repeal the existing “Table III” in Part B, Division 15, of the Food and Drug Regulations, as the list of MRLs will now be published and maintained online.
