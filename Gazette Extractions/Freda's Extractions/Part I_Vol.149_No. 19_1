CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL
COMMENCEMENT OF PUBLIC INTEREST INQUIRY
Concrete reinforcing bar
On January 9, 2015, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal), pursuant to subsection 43(1) of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), found that the dumping of hot-rolled deformed steel concrete reinforcing bar in straight lengths or coils, commonly identified as rebar, in various diameters up to and including 56.4 millimeters, in various finishes, excluding plain round bar and fabricated rebar products, originating in or exported from the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Turkey, and the subsidizing of the aforementioned goods originating or exported from the People's Republic of China had not caused injury but threatened to cause injury to the domestic industry.

The Tribunal is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the imposition of the anti-dumping and countervailing duties, or the imposition of such duties in the full amount, in respect of the aforementioned goods, would not or might not be in the public interest. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to initiate a public interest inquiry (Public Interest Inquiry No. PB-2014-001), pursuant to subsection 45(1) of SIMA, in order to determine whether the imposition of such duties is in the public interest.

The Tribunal plans to publish the results of its public interest inquiry no later than September 14, 2015.

Public hearing
A public hearing relating to this public interest inquiry will be held in Vancouver, British Columbia (exact location to be determined), commencing on July 27, 2015, at 9:30 a.m. The Tribunal will, in due course, provide detailed information to parties on the procedures that it will apply during the hearing.

Participation
Each person or government wishing to participate as a party in the public interest inquiry and at the hearing must file a notice of participation with the Tribunal no later than May 19, 2015, outlining their interest in the inquiry. Each counsel who intends to represent a party in the public interest inquiry and at the hearing must file a notice of representation, as well as a declaration and confidentiality undertaking, with the Tribunal no later than May 19, 2015. Forms for filing notices of participation, notices of representation, and declarations and undertakings are found on the Tribunal's Web site at www.citt-tcce.gc.ca/forms.

To allow the Tribunal to determine whether simultaneous interpretation will be required for the hearing, each interested party and each counsel filing a notice of participation or representation must advise the Tribunal, at the same time that they file the notice, whether they and their witnesses will be using English or French or both languages at the hearing.

Written submissions
The Tribunal will conduct this public interest inquiry by way of written submissions and an oral hearing.

Submissions to the Tribunal may be made in English or in French.

Parties that wish to file submissions supporting a reduction or an elimination of anti-dumping and countervailing duties must do so no later than June 25, 2015. Parties wishing to file submissions opposing a reduction or an elimination of anti-dumping and countervailing duties must do so no later than July 6, 2015. Reply submissions must be filed no later than July 16, 2015. These submissions must be limited to issues raised in opposing parties' submissions. The Tribunal may decide not to accept the filing of reply submissions that include argument or evidence that does not conform to this instruction.

All submissions should provide a concise statement of a party's position. The submission should address the relevant factors referred to in subsection 40.1(3) of the Special Import Measures Regulations. These factors are as follows:

(a) whether goods of the same description are readily available from countries or exporters to which the order or finding does not apply;
(b) whether imposition of an anti-dumping or countervailing duty in the full amount
(i) has eliminated or substantially lessened or is likely to eliminate or substantially lessen competition in the domestic market in respect of goods,
(ii) has caused or is likely to cause significant damage to producers in Canada that use the goods as inputs in the production of other goods and in the provision of services,
(iii) has significantly impaired or is likely to significantly impair competitiveness by
(A) limiting access to goods that are used as inputs in the production of other goods and in the provision of services, or
(B) limiting access to technology, or
(iv) has significantly restricted or is likely to significantly restrict the choice or availability of goods at competitive prices for consumers or has otherwise caused or is otherwise likely to cause them significant harm;
(c) whether non-imposition of an anti-dumping or countervailing duty or the non-imposition of such a duty in the full amount provided for in sections 3 to 6 of the Act is likely to cause significant damage to domestic producers of inputs, including primary commodities, used in the domestic manufacture or production of like goods; and
(d) any other factors that are relevant in the circumstances.
Parties should also make submissions on the recommendation to the Minister of Finance pursuant to subsection 45(5) of SIMA, i.e. either a level of reduction in the anti-dumping or countervailing duty, or a price or prices that are adequate to eliminate the threat of injury to the domestic industry, should the Tribunal form the opinion that the imposition of anti-dumping and/or countervailing duties in the full amount would not or might not be in the public interest.

Confidentiality
Under section 46 of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, a person who wishes some or all of the information that it provides to be kept confidential must submit to the Tribunal, at the time that the information is provided, a statement designating the information as confidential, together with reasons justifying this designation. Furthermore, a person must provide a nonconfidential summary of the information designated as confidential or a statement indicating why such a summary cannot be made. The Tribunal will determine whether the request for confidentiality is warranted.
