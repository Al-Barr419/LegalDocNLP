SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT
Certain 54-inch gypsum board — Decision
On August 20, 2018, pursuant to paragraph 35(1)(b) of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), the Canadian International Trade Tribunal determined, with respect to certain 54-inch gypsum board originating in or exported from the United States of America (United States), imported into Canada for use or consumption in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, as well as the Yukon and Northwest Territories, that the evidence does not disclose a reasonable indication that the dumping of the subject goods has caused injury or retardation or is threatening to cause injury to the domestic industry.

Therefore, the Canada Border Services Agency, pursuant to paragraph 35(2)(a) of SIMA, terminated the investigation of dumping in respect of certain 54-inch gypsum board originating in or exported from the United States, effective August 21, 2018.

SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT
Cold-rolled steel — Decisions
On August 23, 2018, pursuant to subsection 38(1) of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) made preliminary determinations of dumping and subsidizing concerning certain cold-rolled steel in coils or cut lengths from China, South Korea and Vietnam.

The goods in question are usually classified under the following tariff classification numbers:

7209.15.00.00
7209.16.00.00
7209.17.00.00
7209.18.00.00
7209.25.00.00
7209.26.00.00
7209.27.00.00
7209.28.00.00
7209.90.00.00
7211.90.00.00
7211.23.00.00
7211.29.00.00
7225.50.00.00
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) will conduct a full inquiry into the question of injury to the Canadian industry and will make an order or finding not later than 120 days after its receipt of the notice of the preliminary determinations of dumping and subsidizing.

Pursuant to section 8 of SIMA, provisional duties are payable on subject goods that are released from the CBSA during the period commencing August 23, 2018, and ending on the earlier of the day the investigations are terminated, the day on which the CITT makes an order or finding, or the day an undertaking is accepted. The investigations schedule, which has been revised due to a lack of participation from parties, can be viewed on the CBSA website.

The amount of provisional duties payable is not greater than the estimated margin of dumping and the estimated amount of subsidy. The Customs Act applies with respect to the accounting and payment of provisional duties. Therefore, failure to pay duties within the prescribed time will result in the application of the interest provisions of the Customs Act.

Information
The Statement of Reasons regarding these decisions will be issued within 15 days following the decisions and will be available on the CBSA website or by contacting either Mr. Sean Robertson by telephone at 613-954-7409 or Ms. Laurie Trempe by telephone at 613-954-7337.

DETERMINATION
Binoculars
Notice is hereby given that, after completing its inquiry, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal made a determination (File No. PR-2018-001) on August 23, 2018, with respect to a complaint filed by Harris Corporation, of Roanoke, Virginia (USA), pursuant to subsection 30.11(1) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 47 (4th Supp.), concerning a procurement (Solicitation No. M7594-5-4254/B) by the Department of Public Works and Government Services on behalf of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The solicitation was for night vision binoculars.

The complainant alleged that its bid was evaluated in an arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory manner.

Having examined the evidence presented by the parties and considered the provisions of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Revised Agreement on Government Procurement, the Tribunal determined that the complaint was not valid.

Further information may be obtained from the Registrar, Canadian International Trade Tribunal Secretariat, 333 Laurier Avenue West, 15th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G7, 613-993-3595 (telephone), 613-990-2439 (fax), citt-tcce@tribunal.gc.ca (email).
