Ineligibility

(2) No person who was eligible for an ex gratia payment as a veteran or science and technology worker under section 2 of the Order Respecting Ex Gratia Payments to Veterans and Science and Technology Workers Involved in Nuclear Weapons Testing or Nuclear Decontamination footnote1, is eligible for a payment under this Order whether or not the person made an application under that Order.

Death of worker

3 In the case of a worker who would otherwise meet the criteria set out in section 2 but who has died, the Minister is authorized, on application under section 4, to make the payment set out in section 2

EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order.)

Proposal
The Order in Council authorizes the Minister of Natural Resources to make ex gratia payments in the amount of $28,500 to eligible workers employed by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) who took part in the clean-ups of incidents in research reactors at Chalk River Laboratories in 1952 and 1958.

Objective
The Atomic Workers Recognition Program will provide recognition to workers and contractors employed by AECL who, in 1952 and 1958, assisted with the clean-up of two reactor incidents in research reactors at the Chalk River Laboratories.

Background
In 1952 and 1958, two serious nuclear research reactor incidents occurred at the Chalk River Laboratories requiring clean-up activities. In each instance, AECL workers who were qualified stepped in to begin clean-up efforts; however, due to the severity of the situation and the need to keep radiation exposures to safe limits, other AECL staff were asked to volunteer. The deployment of Department of National Defence (DND) personnel became necessary when AECL workers started to reach radiation exposure limits.

While DND’s 2008–2009 Atomic Veterans Recognition Program already recognized the contributions of DND employees to the clean-up of these accidents, employees of AECL were excluded from that program. Following the DND program, and inquiries from AECL workers, the Government examined the need for a similar program that would recognize AECL workers.

Implications
By providing recognition to AECL workers, the Minister of Natural Resources will highlight the contribution of these workers in decades past. The workers themselves, their families, and Canadians will be aware of the important role they played during a time of crisis.

Consultation
Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) has received and responded to letters from those who have written to the Government asking that they or their family member be provided with recognition as was previously provided to the DND personnel some years ago. Since a similar program for AECL workers did not exist at the time, responses noted that the issue was being studied. Following the Budget announcement in 2021, NRCan sent letters to inform all past correspondents that there would be an Atomic Workers Recognition Program.
