CANADA BORDER SERVICES AGENCY
SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT
Certain steel piling pipe — Decisions

On October 31, 2012, the President of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) made a final determination of dumping and a final determination of subsidizing, pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(a) of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), in respect of carbon and alloy steel pipe piles, commonly identified as piling pipe, in outside diameter ranging from 3 1/2 inches up to and including 16 inches (8.9 cm to 40.6 cm) inclusive, in commercial quality and in various forms and finishes, usually supplied to meet ASTM A252, ASTM A500, CSA G.40.21 or comparable specifications or standards, whether single, dual or multiple certified, originating in or exported from the People’s Republic of China, excluding carbon steel welded pipe, in the nominal size range of 3 1/2 inches up to and including 6 inches (89 mm to 168.3 mm) in outside diameter, in various forms and finishes, usually supplied to meet ASTM A252 or equivalent specifications, other than carbon steel welded pipe in the nominal size range of 3 1/2 inches up to and including 6 inches, dual-stencilled to meet the requirements of both specification ASTM A252, Grades 1 to 3, and specification API 5L, with bevelled ends and in random lengths, for use as foundation piles.

Since January 1, 2012, the goods in question are usually classified under the following Harmonized System classification numbers:

7306.30.00.14
7306.30.00.19
7306.30.00.24   
7306.30.00.29  
7306.30.00.34 
7306.30.00.39
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (Tribunal) is continuing its inquiry into the question of injury to the domestic industry and will make an order or finding by November 30, 2012. Provisional duties will continue to apply until this date.

If the Tribunal finds that the dumping and/or subsidizing have caused injury or are threatening to cause injury, future imports of subject goods will be subject to anti-dumping duty equal to the margin of dumping and/or countervailing duty equal to the amount of subsidy on the goods. In that event, the importer in Canada shall pay all such duties. The Customs Act applies, with any modifications that the circumstances require, with respect to the accounting and payment of anti-dumping and countervailing duty.

Information

The Statement of Reasons regarding this decision will be issued within 15 days following the decision and will be available on the CBSA’s Web site at www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/sima-lmsi or by contacting Ian Gallant at 613-954-7186, or by fax at 613-948-4844.
