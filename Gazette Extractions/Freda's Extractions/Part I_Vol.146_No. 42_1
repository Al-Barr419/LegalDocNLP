Notice No. DGSO-004-12 — Consultation on a Licensing Framework for Broadband Radio Service (BRS) — 2500 MHz Band

The intent of this notice is to announce the release of the above-mentioned consultation document on a licensing framework related to the upcoming auction for Broadband Radio Service in the 2500 MHz band. In particular, the consultation seeks comments related to the licensing process, auction format and conditions of licence applicable to the 2500 MHz band.

This consultation follows the March 2012 release of the document entitled Policy and Technical Framework: Mobile Broadband Services (MBS) — 700 MHz Band, Broadband Radio Service (BRS) — 2500 MHz Band, which sets out Industry Canada’s general policy decisions for both the band 698-806 MHz (known as the 700 MHz band) and the band 2500-2690 MHz (known as the 2500 MHz band).

Industry Canada is now seeking comments on licensing considerations related to auction format, rules and processes, as well as on conditions of licence for spectrum in the 2500 MHz band. Although many of the proposals in this consultation are similar to those presented in the April 2012 Consultation on a Licensing Framework for Mobile Broadband Services (MBS) — 700 MHz Band, the two consultations will involve separate considerations and decisions. The inclusion of similar proposals herein should not be taken as an indication of a decision made or direction taken by Industry Canada with respect to the 700 MHz auction.
