DEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT
Ministerial Instructions with respect to the processing of applications for a permanent resident visa made by parents or grandparents of a sponsor as members of the family class and the processing of sponsorship applications made in relation to those applications
These Instructions are published in the Canada Gazette in accordance with subsection 87.3(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Act).

These Instructions are given, pursuant to section 87.3 and subsections 92(1.1) and (2) of the Act, by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration as, in the opinion of the Minister, these Instructions will best support the attainment of the immigration goals established by the Government of Canada by seeing families reunited in Canada. By using a randomized selection process, sponsors will have the same opportunity of having their application accepted for processing within the 10 000 sponsorship applications accepted for processing in any year. As part of the randomized selection process, a period of time will be provided to persons to indicate their interest in making a sponsorship application to sponsor their parents or grandparents. Before 10 000 persons are randomly selected, duplicate entries will be removed, keeping only the most recent entry of a person. Finally, invitations to make a sponsorship application sent by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration (Department) are not transferable, further ensuring fairness in the management of intake into the parent and grandparent program.

Scope
These Instructions apply to applications for a permanent resident visa of sponsors' parents or grandparents made under the family class, referred to in paragraphs 117(1)(c) and (d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (Regulations), respectively, as well as to sponsorship applications made in relation to those applications.

Number of applications to be accepted for processing in a year
A maximum of 10 000 sponsorship applications made in relation to applications for a permanent resident visa, which are made by sponsors' parents or grandparents under the family class, are accepted for processing each year.
