DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT
MIGRATORY BIRDS CONVENTION ACT, 1994
Notice of intent
Notice is hereby given that the Department of the Environment intends to recommend to the Governor in Council that amendments be made to the Migratory Birds Regulations, pursuant to section 12 of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994.

The purpose of these amendments to Schedule I of the Migratory Birds Regulations is to change hunting season dates, set daily bag limits and possession limits, as well as make other related modifications for certain species of migratory game birds for the 2016–17 and 2017–18 hunting seasons. The proposed regulatory amendments are in response to changes in the status of migratory game bird populations and will ensure the sustainable harvest of migratory game bird populations in Canada. These amendments also include administrative changes to the Migratory Birds Regulations.

In 2014, Environment Canada moved to a biennial regulatory amendment cycle for the hunting provisions of the Migratory Birds Regulations. However, Environment Canada continues to evaluate the status of migratory game bird populations on an annual basis to ensure that harvest rates remain sustainable and that urgent regulatory amendments can be made if necessary. The hunting provisions of the Migratory Birds Regulations are reviewed by Environment Canada, with input from the provinces and territories and a range of other interested stakeholders.

Environment Canada produces three reports as part of its consultation process. The first report, issued annually in January and titled Population Status of Migratory Game Birds in Canada, contains population and other biological information on migratory game birds, thus providing the scientific basis for informing management decisions that ensure the long-term sustainability of their population. The second report, issued biennially in January and titled Proposals to Amend the Canadian Migratory Birds Regulations, outlines the proposed changes to the hunting provisions of the Migratory Birds Regulations, as well as proposals to amend the special conservation measures for the management of overabundant species and other proposed amendments to the Regulations. These two reports are distributed to organizations and individuals with an interest in migratory game bird conservation and provide the opportunity for input regarding the proposed regulatory amendments. The third report, Migratory Birds Regulations in Canada, issued biennially in July, summarizes the hunting regulations for the upcoming two hunting seasons, and is also provided to organizations and individuals with an interest in migratory game bird conservation.

Electronic copies of the above-mentioned documents may be viewed at the following address: http://ec.gc.ca/rcom-mbhr/default.asp?lang=En&n=0EA37FB2-1.

Interested parties who wish to comment on the proposed regulatory amendments are invited to submit their comments within a 30-day period after the second report, Proposals to Amend the Canadian Migratory Birds Regulations, has been posted on the Environment Canada Web site. The closing date for consultations will also be on the Web site.

Comments can be submitted to the Director General, Canadian Wildlife Service, Gatineau, Quebec K1A 0H3 or to MBRegs.Reports@ec.gc.ca.
