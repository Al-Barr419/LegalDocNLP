FARM PRODUCTS COUNCIL OF CANADA
FARM PRODUCTS AGENCIES ACT
Notice of public hearings as part of an inquiry into the merits of establishing a red raspberry research, market development and promotion agency
The Farm Products Council of Canada (FPCC) has received from the British Columbia Raspberry Industry Development Council a proposal to establish a red raspberry research, market development and promotion agency, to be funded by levies applied on fresh and processed red raspberries and red raspberry products marketed domestically and imported.

The Council, pursuant to section 8 of the Farm Products Agencies Act (the Act), hereby provides notice that pursuant to the direction of the Chairman, a panel, consisting of two members of the Council, will hold public hearings to determine the merits of establishing such an agency, pursuant to section 39 of the Act.

The Panel has determined the place and time of the pre-hearing conference (please see the notice below). The panellists are Council members Mr. Tim O'Connor as Panel Chair and Mr. Phil Klassen.

The Panel will submit the results of its inquiry to the full Council and the Council will make recommendations to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

The Panel will inquire into and review

(a) the current structure of the Canadian red raspberry industry and the degree of support among producers and importers for establishing an agency;
(b) the potential effects of establishing a national agency on the operations of producers and importers;
(c) the means for ensuring that an agency has due regard for the interests of producers, importers and consumers;
(d) the degree and nature of federal-provincial cooperation required to implement the proposed national plan, including the proposed “phase-in” approach to provincial participation, the efficient dovetailing of levy collection under federal and provincial jurisdictions and its consistency with the Agreement on Internal Trade;
(e) the collection of levies on imported raspberries, including its consistency with Canada's rights and obligations under international trade agreements; and
(f) whether any restrictions should be placed on the activities of a raspberry research and promotion agency or on any of the powers to be exercised pursuant to section 42 of the Act.
