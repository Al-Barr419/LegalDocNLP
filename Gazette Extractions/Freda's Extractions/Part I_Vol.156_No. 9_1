Proposal
The Order Repealing Interim Order No. 2 Respecting Clinical Trials for Medical Devices and Drugs Relating to COVID-19 (the Order), made by the Minister of Health on February 14, 2022, repeals the Interim Order No. 2 Respecting Clinical Trials for Medical Devices and Drugs Relating to COVID-19 (the Interim Order No. 2), made by the Minister of Health on May 3, 2021.

The Order also triggers the coming into force of sections 1 to 53 of the Governor in Council regulations — known as the Clinical Trials for Medical Devices and Drugs Relating to COVID-19 Regulations (the Regulations) — that replace the Interim Order No. 2, which come into force the day after the day on which the Order comes into force. The Regulations allow for the continued conduct of COVID-19 medical device and drug clinical trials under a flexible regulatory pathway, and they also maintain the flexibilities of the Interim Order No. 2. Sections 54 to 57 of the Regulations come into force on the day on which they are registered.
