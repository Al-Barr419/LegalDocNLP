The CITT will make a decision within 60 days of the date of initiation. If the CITT concludes that the evidence does not disclose a reasonable indication of retardation, the investigation will be terminated.

Information
The Statement of Reasons regarding the decision will be issued within 15 days following the decision and will be available on the CBSA website or by contacting the SIMA Registry and Disclosure Unit by telephone at 613-948-4605 or by email at simaregistry@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca.
