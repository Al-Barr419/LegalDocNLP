DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT
MIGRATORY BIRDS CONVENTION ACT, 1994
Notice with respect to temporary possession of migratory birds

In order to conduct a survey for avian viruses, the Canadian Minister of the Environment has issued a notice under the authority of section 36 of the Migratory Birds Regulations to vary the application of paragraph 6(b) of the Migratory Bird Regulations to allow for the temporary possession of found-dead migratory birds. A person is permitted to temporarily possess dead migratory birds to allow for “swift delivery” of such birds to provincial or territorial authorities for analysis. In all other circumstances, a prohibition against possessing the carcass of a migratory bird remains in effect. This notice comes into force for a period of one year from September 6, 2012. The Government of Canada is responsible, under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, to ensure that populations of migratory birds are maintained, protected and conserved.

The Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre coordinates Canada’s Interagency Wild Bird Influenza Survey. Information on where to submit found dead migratory birds is available by viewing the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre Web site at www.ccwhc.ca/contact_us.php or by telephoning 1-800-567-2033. Guidance on precautions for the handling of wild birds is available from the Public Health Agency of Canada on its Web site: www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/influenza/fs-hwb-fr-mos-eng.php.
