CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999
Final guidelines for Canadian drinking water quality for metribuzin
Pursuant to subsection 55(3) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, the Minister of Health hereby gives notice of the final guidelines for Canadian drinking water quality for metribuzin. The technical document for these guidelines is available on the Water Quality website. This document underwent a public consultation period of 60 days in 2020 and was updated to take into consideration the comments received.

ANNEX
Guidelines
The maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) for metribuzin in drinking water is 0.08 mg/L (80 μg/L).

Executive summary
This guideline technical document was prepared in collaboration with the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Drinking Water and is based on assessments of metribuzin completed by Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency and supporting documents.

Exposure
Metribuzin is a pre- and post-emergent herbicide used to control broadleaf weeds and grasses in agriculture. In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available, more than 100 000 kg of metribuzin (as an active ingredient) was sold in Canada.

Metribuzin is released into the environment as surface runoff following agricultural spraying (particularly within two weeks of soil application), as tile drain effluent, from accidental discharge or as spray drift. It has the potential to leach into groundwater or move into surface water.

Data provided by provinces and territories that monitor for metribuzin indicate that metribuzin is not commonly found in source or drinking water in Canada. However, low levels of metribuzin have been found in source and treated drinking water in a few Canadian provinces during targeted monitoring programs in agricultural areas where metribuzin is applied. Although metribuzin is used on food crops, it is rarely detected in foods.

Health effects
In repeat-dose animal studies, metribuzin primarily targeted the liver and, to a lesser extent, the thyroid, but did not cause birth defects, reproductive effects or an increase in cancer. Of the available studies in humans, there was no relationship between exposure to metribuzin and the incidence of cancer or Parkinson's disease. The MAC of 0.08 mg/L (80 µg/L) is based on liver effects seen in a two-year dog study.

Analytical and treatment considerations
The establishment of drinking water guidelines takes into consideration the ability to both measure the contaminant and remove it from drinking water supplies. Several analytical methods are available for measuring metribuzin in water at concentrations well below the MAC.

At the municipal level, treatment technologies that are available to effectively decrease metribuzin concentrations in drinking water include oxidation, activated carbon adsorption, and membrane filtration. These technologies are capable of achieving treated water concentrations well below the MAC. Although metribuzin may be removed by common oxidants used for disinfection (e.g. chlorine), utilities should be aware of the potential formation of degradation by-products.

In cases where metribuzin removal is desired at a small system or household level — for example, when the drinking water supply is from a private well — a residential drinking water treatment unit may be an option. Although there are no treatment units currently certified for the removal of metribuzin from drinking water, activated carbon adsorption and reverse osmosis technologies are expected to be effective. When using a residential drinking water treatment unit, it is important to take samples of water entering and leaving the treatment unit and send them to an accredited laboratory for analysis to ensure that adequate metribuzin removal is occurring.

Application of the guidelines
Note: Specific guidance related to the implementation of drinking water guidelines should be obtained from the appropriate drinking water authority.

The guidelines are protective against health effects from exposure to metribuzin in drinking water over a lifetime. Any exceedance of the MAC should be investigated and followed by the appropriate corrective actions if required. For exceedances in source water where there is no treatment in place, additional monitoring to confirm the exceedance should be conducted. If it is confirmed that source water metribuzin concentrations are above the MAC, then an investigation to determine the most appropriate way to reduce exposure to metribuzin should be conducted. This may include use of an alternate water supply or installation of treatment. Where treatment is already in place and an exceedance occurs, an investigation should be conducted to verify treatment and to determine whether adjustments are needed to lower the treated water concentration below the MAC.
