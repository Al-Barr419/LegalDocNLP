CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL
INQUIRY
Professional, administrative and management support services
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) has received a complaint (File No. PR-2015-043) from StenoTran Services Inc. and Atchison & Denman Court Reporting Services Ltd. (StenoTran), of Ottawa, Ontario, concerning a procurement (Solicitation No. 5X001-15-0242) by the Courts Administration Service (CAS). The solicitation is for court reporting and transcription services in Federal Court and Tax Court of Canada proceedings in Ontario except Ottawa, in Federal Court and Tax Court of Canada proceedings in Ottawa and in Federal Court designated proceedings in the province of Ontario. Pursuant to subsection 30.13(2) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act and subsection 7(2) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Procurement Inquiry Regulations, notice is hereby given that the Tribunal made a decision on December 14, 2015, to conduct an inquiry into the complaint.

The Tribunal has decided to inquire into StenoTran's allegation that the bids submitted in response to the solicitation were no longer valid and that the CAS consequently improperly issued three sole-source court reporting and transcription services contracts.

Further information may be obtained from the Registrar, Canadian International Trade Tribunal Secretariat, 333 Laurier Avenue West, 15th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G7, 613-993-3595 (telephone), 613-990-2439 (fax), citt-tcce@tribunal.gc.ca (email).
