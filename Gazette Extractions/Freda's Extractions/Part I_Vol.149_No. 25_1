EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order.)

Proposal and objective
This Order in Council is required pursuant to section 52 of the National Energy Board Act (NEB Act) and section 31 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA, 2012) to approve the issuance of Certificate GC-125, authorizing the construction and operation of the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) North Montney Mainline (the Project).

Background
On November 8, 2013, NGTL applied to the National Energy Board (Board or NEB), under section 52 of the NEB Act, requesting that a certificate of public convenience and necessity (Certificate) be issued for the Project.

The Project would include

the Aitken Creek Section, approximately 182 kilometres (km) of 1067 mm nominal pipe size (NPS 42) outside diameter pipeline from Aitken Creek to an interconnection with the existing Saturn Section of the Groundbirch Mainline of the NGTL System;
the Kahta Section, approximately 119 km of 1067 mm (NPS 42) pipeline facilities from the North Montney producing area to Aitken Creek;
three compressor stations with bi-directional capability: two on the Aitken Creek Section and one on the existing Groundbirch Mainline;
sixteen meter stations with six on the Aitken Creek Section and ten on the Kahta Section, one of which will be a bi-directional storage meter station; it would connect the Aitken Creek Section to the Aitken Creek Storage facility (Aitken Creek Interconnect); and
temporary infrastructure required for the construction of the Project.
The Project will be located in northeastern British Columbia (BC), and is designed to transport sweet natural gas from the North Montney area to interconnections with the NGTL System and to the proposed Prince Rupert Gas Transmission (PRGT) pipeline. These interconnections will allow gas sales to gas markets across North America and to markets overseas as liquefied natural gas (LNG). Purchase and sale of the North Montney gas delivered to Alberta via NGTL would be facilitated through the NOVA Inventory Transfer (NIT) market, which is a natural gas trading hub where gas is bought and sold electronically.

The Project costs are estimated at $1.67 billion. The Project will have an initial gas transportation capacity of 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), expandable to 3.6 Bcf/d. The Project was reviewed by an NEB Panel composed of three members.

Implications
Socio-economic impacts
The Project will inject $1.67 billion in direct investment into the Canadian economy. NGTL estimated Canada-wide employment during construction at 4 077 full-time equivalents (FTEs), benefiting mostly job seekers in BC and Alberta. Indirect employment through contracting activities is expected to be about 3 977 FTEs. NGTL has estimated federal and provincial governments' direct and indirect economic benefits associated with the Project at $161 million and $135 million, respectively.

The Project will be a major natural gas development infrastructure enabling industry to tap into huge natural gas reserves in place in the region, estimated at 604 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). It will contribute to marketing 84 Tcf of the resource in place. It will also play a key role in LNG market development in Canada. Progress Energy Canada Ltd. (Progress), an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS), is the largest leaseholder in the North Montney area and the Project's main shipper. It is committed to supplying natural gas from the North Montney area to the Pacific NorthWest LNG Project, which is a proposed LNG liquefaction and export facility (PNW LNG Facility), situated on the coast of BC in Prince Rupert. The proposed PRGT will connect the PNW LNG Facility to the Project at the Mackie Creek Interconnection, which will allow NGTL to deliver 2.1 Bcf/d to Progress starting in 2019.

The NEB is satisfied that NGTL has identified and considered all relevant socio-economic aspects of the Project, and has proposed suitable mitigations to address the Project's potential adverse socio-economic effects. The NEB concludes that the proposed Project would provide benefits to Aboriginal, local, regional and provincial economies and that any adverse socio-economic impacts of the Project would be adequately addressed by NGTL.

Tolling methodology impacts
NGTL proposed to use a rolled-in tolling methodology whereby current NGTL shippers would help pay for the Project. NGTL argued that the Project will be physically and operationally integrated to its NGTL System, be broadly used by most shippers, and provide an additional source of supply to the NGTL System.

The NEB approved the applied-for rolled-in tolling design during only a transition period (from 2016 to 2018), but imposed specific conditions. The conditions include a requirement for NGTL to maintain a separate cost pool and separate accounting records for the Project. When North Montney gas production is first delivered at the Mackie Creek Interconnection to the PRGT pipeline in 2019, NGTL will then have the option to implement stand-alone tolling on the Project, which will increase tolls, or to apply to the NEB for a revised tolling methodology.

NEB toll decisions are not subject to Governor in Council (GIC) approval or to ministerial review.

Environmental impacts
Because the proposed pipeline is over 40 km in length, it is a designated project under the CEAA, 2012. Pursuant to CEAA, 2012 requirements, the NEB conducted a rigorous and comprehensive environmental assessment (EA). Issues reviewed included environmental protection, land use, lands and resources for traditional uses, impacts on vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat, fish and fish habitat, atmospheric and acoustic environment, water quality and quantity, and heritage resources.

The Project runs alongside of existing linear disturbances over 154 km (51% of its length). Participants in the review identified several key environmental issues, including soil, water and air quality, wildlife and wildlife habitat, species at risk, wetlands, migratory birds, and cumulative effects (see footnote 1).

Nine Aboriginal groups participated in identifying the Project potential impacts on Aboriginal traditional land and resource use. Their concerns relate mostly to the cumulative impacts of industrial development on every aspect of their traditional way of life.

Three Aboriginal groups, including Blueberry River First Nations (BRFN), Prophet River First Nation (PRFN) and Saulteau First Nations (SFN), were concerned by the rapid industrialization pace, which drives cumulative effects on their traditional land and resource use.

A majority of the Board's Panel determined that, with the implementation of NGTL's environmental protection procedures and mitigation measures, along with the Board's recommended conditions, the Project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. The Board conditions included three that are specific to the Peace Moberly Tract (PMT). (see footnote 2) These three conditions require that NGTL develop a protection plan that outlines additional measures that will be implemented to eliminate or minimize the Project's potential effects within the PMT, in consultation with the SFN, the West Moberly First Nations (WMFN) and relevant government authorities. The protection and consultation plans must be submitted to the NEB for approval prior to construction. NGTL is also required to report to the NEB on its consultation efforts and on the effectiveness of the measures implemented regarding the PMT through monitoring reports during operations.

One Panel member dissented with the Panel majority, concluding that the Project would likely cause significant adverse effects to the current Aboriginal use of land and resources for traditional purposes within the PMT, an area of high value to Aboriginal people, which is traversed by an 8.8 km of the proposed pipeline. Therefore, he recommended that the GIC approve the Kahta to Mackie Creek section of the Project, but not the pipeline section that would traverse the PMT (from Mackie Creek to Saturn). Alternatively, the dissenting Panel member recommended that the recommendation be sent back to the NEB for reconsideration, before the GIC makes a final decision on the section of the proposed Project that goes through the PMT.

Impacts on landowners
The Project would be located on private and provincial Crown lands. Approximately 16% (or 29 km) of the Aitken Creek Section will be on freehold land and 84% (or 153 km) on provincial Crown land, while 100% of the Kahta Section will be located on provincial Crown land.

The NEB approved the Project routing and found the NGTL's process for land acquisition acceptable.

Consultation
Process
On February 5, 2014, the NEB issued the Hearing Order GH-001-2014, setting out the process and providing a list of issues to be considered. The NEB carried out two oral hearing portions for six days each in Calgary, Alberta and Fort St. John, BC.

The Board determined that 51 applicants were eligible to participate, of which 39 parties were granted an intervenor status and 12 participated as commenters. There were 37 commercial parties and 3 government participants, including Environment Canada (EC), the BC Ministry of Natural Gas Development and Alberta Energy. EC participated in the review process in the capacity of a commenter.

Seven Aboriginal groups (see footnote 3) participated as intervenors in the review process. Oral traditional evidence was submitted by four First Nations. The Board received seven eligible Participant Funding Program applications from Aboriginal groups and a landowner. These applicants received funding awards totalling $235,550.

Stakeholder issues
Commercial parties
NGTL's proposed rolled-in tolling was of concern to most commercial parties during proceedings. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and Progress supported the Project and NGTL's proposed rolled-in tolling. They recommended the issuance of a Certificate for the Project.

Other commercial parties, including Alliance Pipeline Ltd., ATCO Gas, a division of ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd., (see footnote 4) the Export Users Group, (see footnote 5) FortisBC Energy Inc. and Westcoast Energy Inc., most of whom are NGTL's competitors, opposed NGTL's proposed rolled-in tolling for various reasons, including unfair competition, economic inefficiency, cross-subsidization and the high risk borne by current NGTL System customers due to uncertainty around the LNG liquefaction facility project.

Aboriginal groups
Five of the seven Aboriginal groups who participated in the review, namely the BRFN, the Fort Nelson First Nation (FNFN), the PRFN, the SFN and the WMFN, were concerned by the inability to input into the Project design, the potential Project-related effects on traditional land and resource use, and field research methods and data collection protocols used by NGTL.

These Aboriginal groups stressed that the Project will intensify the cumulative effects of increased industrialization on their traditional use of land and resources, which would affect their ability to carry on their cultural and traditional way of life. For the PRFN, NGTL's preferred route for the Project crosses their Treaty 8 territory. The WMFN argued that increased industrialization has gradually encroached on its territory, limiting its ability to exercise traditional activities in the areas. The BRFN is also concerned that the Project will impact three areas of high importance to them, including the area northwest of Beryl Prairie, the Pink Mountain area, and the area north of Wonowon. Both the SFN and the WMFN see the PMT as being of high cultural and spiritual value to them.

NGTL argued that its preferred route is the optimal solution that balances all considerations, including commercial, stakeholder, environmental, socio-economic and technical considerations.

The NEB found that all potentially affected Aboriginal groups were provided with sufficient information about the Project, and had an opportunity to make their views about the Project known to NGTL and to the NEB. Except for the portion of the Project that crosses the PMT area, the NEB had no concerns about the Project route. To address residual concerns about the Project routing through the PMT, the Board imposed several conditions on the Project.

Governments
With respect to wildlife and wildlife habitat and caribou, EC determined that there is potential that the Project may result in the destruction of critical habitat for the Graham local population unit and recommended the avoidance of all activities likely to destroy critical habitat, in a manner that is consistent with the Species at Risk Act (SARA) and the Recovery Strategy for the Woodland Caribou, Southern Mountain Caribou Population.

Regarding the Northern Mountain caribou, EC determined that a portion of the pipeline right-of-way (RoW) is located within the Pink Mountain local population unit and recommended that all activities be consistent with the Northern Mountain Caribou Management Plan.

Crown consultation
The Crown owes a duty to consult and accommodate Aboriginal groups where appropriate when it considers conduct which could adversely impact Aboriginal and treaty rights. For the Project, the Crown relied on the NEB review process and its own consultative activities to discharge its duty to consult. The Crown determined that the NEB process was fair and helped potentially affected Aboriginal groups to make their concerns known to the NEB and NGTL, and that these concerns have been adequately addressed by imposing 45 terms and conditions to which the Certificate would be subject. These 45 conditions would mitigate any potential effects and ensure that the Project can be constructed and operated safely for Canadians and for the environment. The conditions imposed would ensure that the potential effects of the Project on Aboriginal and treaty rights and the traditional use of lands and resources would be eliminated or minimized throughout the Project's life cycle.

NEB approval
The Board's Panel majority recommended that a Certificate be issued under section 52 of the NEB Act for the construction and operation of the proposed North Montney Mainline. The majority of the Panel recommended that, with the 45 terms and conditions contained in Appendix II of the NEB Report, the Project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects and is in the public interest.
