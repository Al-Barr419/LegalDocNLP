CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL
COMMENCEMENT OF SAFEGUARD INQUIRY
Certain steel goods
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal has been directed by Her Excellency the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to paragraph 20(a) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, to inquire into and report on the importation of the following seven classes of goods: (1) energy tubular; (2) heavy plate; (3) hot-rolled sheet; (4) pre-painted steel; (5) concrete reinforcing bar; (6) wire rod; and (7) stainless steel wire. A full description of each class of goods is in the schedule of the Order Referring to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, for Inquiry into and Reporting on, the Matter of the Importation of Certain Steel Goods (Order in Council).

The purpose of this inquiry (Inquiry No. GC-2018-001) is to determine whether any of the above-mentioned goods are being imported into Canada in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to be a principal cause of serious injury or threat thereof to Canadian producers of like or directly competitive goods.

Imports from the United States, Israel and other beneficiaries of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, Chile and Mexico (with the exception of energy tubular and wire rod classes of goods) are excluded from the Tribunal's inquiry. For the sake of clarity, imports of energy tubular and wire rod from Mexico are within the scope of the Tribunal's inquiry.

The Tribunal is being directed, if it makes an affirmative determination for any class of goods, to recommend the most appropriate remedy to address, over a period of three years, the injury or threat of injury, in accordance with Canada's rights and obligations under international trade agreements.

The Tribunal must report to the Minister by April 3, 2019.
