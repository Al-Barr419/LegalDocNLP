REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS STATEMENT
(This statement is not part of the Regulations.)

Issues
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is funded by employers, employees and self-employed individuals. The provisions of the Canada Pension Plan (the CPP Act) require every employer paying remuneration to an employee with respect to pensionable employment to deduct the employee's contributions from that remuneration, in accordance with the rules prescribed in the Canada Pension Plan Regulations (the Regulations), and to remit these contributions together with the employer's contributions to the Receiver General of Canada. Self-employed individuals are required to remit contributions equal to those of the employee and employer.

The CPP Act was amended in 2016 to provide for the enhancement of the retirement pension, the survivor's and disability pensions, and the post-retirement benefit contributors will receive. These enhancements are to be funded by additional contributions by employees, employers and self-employed individuals beginning in 2019. As a result of these legislative amendments, the Minister of National Revenue will be recommending that the Regulations be amended to reflect the additional contributions and increased earning limits.

Background
On October 6, 2016, the Government of Canada (with the concurrence of all nine participating provinces) introduced Bill C-26, An Act to amend the Canada Pension Plan, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act and the Income Tax Act (the amending Act) in order to enhance future retirement pensions and supplementary benefits. The Bill received royal assent on December 15, 2016. The amending Act consists of two parts: Part 1 was brought into force by the Governor in Council on March 2, 2017, and Part 2 will come into force on January 1, 2019.

Part 1 of the amending Act amends the CPP Act to

(a) increase the amount of the retirement pension from one quarter to one third of eligible earnings;
(b) increase survivor and disability pensions and post-retirement benefits;
(c) increase the maximum level of eligible earnings by 14% by 2025;
(d) increase contributions, beginning in 2019 and phased in gradually over seven years; and
(e) provide for the accounting and financial review of the enhanced portion of the CPP.
Part 2 of the amending Act makes amendments to the Income Tax Act to increase the working income tax benefit as a means of offsetting the contribution increases for eligible low-income workers and to provide a deduction for the additional employee contributions to avoid increasing the after-tax cost of savings for Canadians.

This is the first major reform to the benefit levels since the establishment of the CPP in 1966. Young Canadians just entering the workforce will see the largest increase in benefits. Once fully implemented in 2025, the maximum retirement benefit will be increased by about 50% over the current (2017) maximum benefit of $13,370 annually. In terms of today's dollar, the enhanced benefits represent an increase of nearly $7,000 to a maximum benefit of nearly $20,000 annually. Enhanced benefits will accumulate gradually as contributions made to the CPP increase.

Currently, employees contribute to the CPP if they are over the age of 18, work in Canada (outside of Quebec) and earn more than $3,500 a year. They only contribute on earnings between $3,500 and the annual earnings limit (known as the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings or YMPE), which is adjusted each year based on changes in the average wage in Canada.

In 2017, the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings were set at $55,300. The contribution rate for employees is currently set at 4.95% of the above-described earnings. This contribution is defined in the CPP Act as the employee's base contribution. Employers make contributions equal to those of the employees. Self-employed individuals make a contribution equivalent to both the employee and employer portions, which is equal to a rate of 9.9% of their eligible earnings.

Employee's first additional contribution
From 2019 to 2023, the contribution rate for employees will gradually increase by a total of one percentage point (that is from 4.95% to 5.95% on earnings between $3,500 and the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings). This graduated increase in contributions is defined in the CPP Act as the employee's first additional contribution. These increases will be introduced according to the following increments:

2019: 0.15%
2020: 0.3%
2021: 0.5%
2022: 0.75%
2023: 1.00%
In order to alleviate the burden of calculating this annual rate increase, the employee's base contribution and the employee's first additional contribution will be deducted, remitted and reported by the employer as one contribution. Employers are required to make an equivalent contribution.

Employee's second additional contribution
Beginning in 2024, there will be a two-year phase-in of a new range of earnings. There will also be a separate contribution rate for employees equal to 4% on these earnings. This range will start at the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings for 2024 (projected to be approximately $70,100) and will extend to the new upper limit or the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings. The Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings will be calculated by taking the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings for 2024 and increasing it by 7%. It is projected that in 2024, the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings will be approximately $75,000 ($70,100 × 107% = $75,000).

For 2025 and for subsequent years, the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings is estimated to be equal to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings for 2025, increased by 14% or $82,700 ($72,500 × 114% = $82,700). This additional contribution is defined in the CPP Act as the employee's second additional contribution and will be required on an ongoing basis starting in 2024. As a result, the more one earns, the more one will contribute towards future benefits.

Employers will pay the same increases in contributions as their employees. In the case of self-employed individuals, they will contribute the equivalent of both the employee and employer portions. This means they will pay a contribution rate of 11.9% on earnings up to the original earnings limit and 8% on the additional earnings range.

The gradual and scaled implementation of the legislated increases to the contribution rate and the upper earnings limit is deliberately intended to allow a significant amount of time for businesses and employees to adjust and make the necessary changes in order to accommodate the additional contributions to the CPP.

Objectives
The objective of these proposed regulatory amendments is to operationalize the changes made to the CPP Act by prescribing the rules necessary to calculate the amount of the additional required contributions by employees, employers and self-employed individuals, as well as to address recent amendments to related federal and Quebec legislation.

Description
The Regulations would be amended to add the definitions and the formulas necessary for calculating the required increases in contributions.

Additionally, the following technical amendments would also be made to the Regulations:

Under the current provisions of the Regulations, when an employee who works in Quebec (and therefore contributes to the Quebec Pension Plan [QPP] at a higher rate than the contribution rate of the CPP) is transferred by their employer before the end of the calendar year to a location outside of Quebec, an insufficient amount of total CPP and QPP contributions may have been made which, in turn, may impact future benefits. A new provision would be added to the Regulations prescribing the formula to be used to reconcile the amounts contributed to both plans in order to ensure that sufficient contributions to the federal plan are withheld in this circumstance.
On June 22, 2017, the Income Tax Act was amended to allow employers to provide an electronic copy of their T4 — Statement of Remuneration Paid to their employees instead of a paper copy as previously required. Since the Regulations currently contain a provision requiring that a paper copy of the T4 be given to the employee, amendments to the Regulations are required to allow the same method of distribution for purposes of the administration of the CPP.
On February 21, 2018, the Government of Quebec passed legislative amendments to enhance the QPP in ways similar to the changes to the federal plan. Quebec will impose the same percentage increase in the maximum pensionable earnings as well as a gradual increase in contributions over the same seven-year period, as of January 1, 2019. As a result, minor changes are proposed to one provision of the Regulations to reflect the new multi-level contribution structure of the provincial plan.
"One-for-One" Rule
The "One-for-One" Rule does not apply to the proposed regulatory amendments, as they would not result in any changes in administrative costs for businesses. Employers will have to modify their contribution rates, but the procedures they currently follow to deduct, remit and report contributions are not expected to change. Accordingly, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) does not expect these regulatory amendments to result in any new administrative burden, and only very minimal compliance burden (i.e. associated with having to update the contribution rates).

Small business lens
The small business lens does not apply to this proposal, as there is no change in administrative costs to business resulting from these regulatory amendments, recognizing that the requirement for additional contributions to be paid by employers falls under the CPP Act.

Consultation
In order to provide information, and answer questions, on how the enhanced benefits and the new contribution requirements will be rolled out, the CRA made presentations to officials of Public Services and Procurement Canada (who is responsible for administering the Phoenix pay system for federal public servants) in June 2017, to the Canadian Payroll Association in June 2017 (with further updates on the development of the proposed amendments in September and October 2017), and to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business in November 2017.

Stakeholders expressed support in response to CRA's intention to maintain the same procedures for calculating, withholding, reporting and remitting CPP contributions. The CRA plans to further engage representatives of the Canadian business community, accounting professionals and payroll service providers in 2018 to support the implementation of these changes.

Rationale
The Government of Canada introduced legislative amendments to the CPP Act to enhance pensions and supplementary benefits, and to provide for additional contributions by employees, employers and self-employed individuals. Any contributions to the CPP will bear enhanced benefits to contributors. The proposed regulatory amendments support the implementation of the enhanced benefits by outlining the rules that must be followed.

The costs associated with the implementation of the enhanced benefits stem from the amendments to the CPP Act. There will be new costs associated with these changes for businesses, including small businesses, as the contributions are increasing, and time and resources will be spent to perform the calculation of the gradually increasing contributions. Given that the existing practices and procedures for the collection, remitting and reporting of contributions will remain the same, and only the contribution rates will change, the impact on employees, employers, self-employed individuals and the CRA associated with the implementation of these amendments is expected to be minimal.

Implementation, enforcement and service standards
The CRA is making every effort to ensure that implementing the proposed enhancements to the CPP will be as smooth as possible for employees, employers and self-employed individuals. Current calculating, remitting and reporting obligations will continue for employers and self-employed individuals.

For each year beginning with 2019, employers will have to adjust their calculations to combine the employee's base contribution rate and the employee's first additional contribution rate (as described above), and calculate and make the matching employer's first additional contribution. For each year beginning with 2024, employers will also have to calculate and withhold the separate employee's second additional contribution on greater pensionable earnings (as described above) and calculate and make the matching employer's second additional contribution.

The current reporting requirements will be maintained. With respect to the employees, employers will report the amount of the employee's base and additional contributions as one contribution on the employee's pay statement for each pay period. Employers will also continue to report the total of each employee's CPP contributions on the employee's T4 — Statement of Remuneration Paid (as well as other amounts deducted, such as employment insurance premiums and income tax deducted) for income tax filing purposes. Employers will also continue to file a T4 — Summary, Summary of Remuneration Paid when remitting the employee and employer contributions (along with other amounts withheld at source) to the Receiver General of Canada.

The CRA will also be providing employers and self-employed individuals with payroll deduction tables/ formulas that will enable them to make one deduction (combining base and additional contributions) from an employee's remuneration.

The CRA will use data provided by individuals in preparing their income tax returns as well as information provided by employers on their T4 — Statement of Remuneration Paid to correctly calculate the amount of the base and additional contributions withheld.

The CRA plans to provide additional information explaining the CPP deductions to employers and individuals through various tools, including, but not limited to

— updated CRA guides and CRA web content;
— webinar offerings for employers on the changes;
— presentations at national association conferences; and
— consultations with stakeholders.
