DEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION
STRENGTHENING CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP ACT
Notice requesting comments on a proposal to amend the Citizenship Regulations to implement certain provisions of the Citizenship Act, as amended by the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act
Summary
Notice is hereby given that Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) is seeking written comments from all interested parties on a proposal to amend the Citizenship Regulations to implement the revocation provisions of the Citizenship Act, as amended by the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act (SCCA).

Background
On June 19, 2014, Bill C-24, the SCCA, which is the first comprehensive reform to the Citizenship Act since 1977, received royal assent. The Bill includes measures to

increase efficiency of the citizenship program to improve application processing and help qualified applicants acquire citizenship faster;
reinforce the value of citizenship by strengthening the requirements and deterring citizenship of convenience;
improve the tools to maintain program integrity and combat fraud; and
protect and promote Canada's interests and values by honouring those who serve Canada.
This legislation stemmed from several government commitments, including the March 2010 Speech from the Throne, which indicated that legislation would be introduced to streamline the revocation of citizenship and to take steps against consultants who seek to defraud the system. Building on this undertaking, the 2013 Speech from the Throne promised a comprehensive reform of the Citizenship Act. The SCCA fulfills these commitments.

On royal assent and on August 1, 2014, certain provisions of the Citizenship Act, as amended by the SCCA, came into force, including provisions to streamline decision making on applications for grants of citizenship with the objective of reducing processing times. Preparations are underway to support the implementation of the revocation provisions of the Citizenship Act, as amended by the SCCA, which aim to reinforce the values of citizenship and better protect the safety and security of Canadians.  The revocation provisions include new expanded grounds for revocation of Canadian citizenship and establish a streamlined decision-making process. The new grounds will provide authority to revoke citizenship from dual citizens who have served as a member of an armed force or organized armed group engaged in armed conflict with Canada and those convicted of terrorism, high treason, treason or spying, depending on the sentence imposed.

Under the provisions regarding the streamlined decision-making process, decisions to revoke Canadian citizenship will be made by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration or the Federal Court, depending on the ground for revocation. The Minister will decide on revocation cases involving the convictions listed above and most cases involving fraud. Cases to be decided by the Federal Court would be those cases of fraud involving concerns related to security, organized criminality, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and also cases involving membership in an armed force or organized armed group engaged in armed conflict with Canada, given that such cases raise complex issues of fact and law. In revocation cases based on fraud decided by the Federal Court, the Court could also be asked to make a finding of inadmissibility. This would allow for a removal order to be issued earlier in the process.

Description
The purpose of this Notice of Intent is to signal an intention to amend the Citizenship Regulations in order to implement the revocation provisions of the Citizenship Act, as amended by the SCCA.

In revocation proceedings where the Minister is the decision-maker, the Citizenship Act, as amended by the SCCA, provides that an oral hearing may be held if the Minister, on the basis of prescribed factors, is of the opinion that an oral hearing is required. Authority is also given to the Governor in Council (GIC) to make regulations to prescribe factors for the Minister to consider in deciding whether an oral hearing is required in a particular case.

Therefore, the objective of the proposed regulations is to prescribe the factors to consider in deciding whether an oral hearing is required when the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is the decision-maker. These factors could include (1) an issue regarding credibility resulting from the evidence; (2) a person's inability to make a written submission; or (3) whether the ground for revocation is based on a foreign conviction.

Comments
This Notice of Intent is an opportunity for the public to provide comments and input into the proposed regulatory amendments described above before the regulations are published in the Canada Gazette, Part II.

Anyone may, within 10 days of the publication of this notice, provide comments on this Notice of Intent, in writing, to the person named below at the address provided.

Questions and requests for additional information, as well as comments on this Notice of Intent, may be directed to Himmat Shinhat, Director, Legislation and Program Policy, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 180 Kent Street, 6th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 1L1, 613-991-2485 (fax), Citizenship-Citoyennete@cic.gc.ca (email).
