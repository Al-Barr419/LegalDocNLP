CANADA BORDER SERVICES AGENCY
SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT
Certain concrete reinforcing bar — Decisions
On December 10, 2014, the President of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) made a final determination of dumping pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(a) of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), in respect of hot-rolled deformed steel concrete reinforcing bar in straight lengths or coils, commonly identified as rebar, in various diameters up to and including 56.4 millimeters, in various finishes, excluding plain round bar and fabricated rebar products, originating in or exported from the People’s Republic of China (China), the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Turkey (Turkey) and made a final determination of subsidizing in respect of the above-mentioned goods originating in or exported from China.

On the same date, pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(b) of SIMA, the President of the CBSA terminated the subsidy investigation in respect of the above-mentioned goods originating in or exported from the Republic of Korea and Turkey.

The subject goods are usually classified under the following Harmonized System classification numbers:

7213.10.00.00
7214.20.00.00
The subject goods may also be classified under the following Harmonized System classification numbers:

7215.90.00.90
7227.90.00.90
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (Tribunal) is continuing its inquiry into the question of injury to the domestic industry and will make a finding by January 9, 2015. Provisional duties will continue to apply until this date on imports of subject goods from the three named countries. However, the provisional duties related to the subsidization of goods from the Republic of Korea and Turkey will no longer apply, and the provisional duty paid or security posted will be returned.

If the Tribunal finds that the dumping and/or subsidizing have caused injury or are threatening to cause injury, anti-dumping duty equal to the margin of dumping and/or countervailing duty equal to the amount of subsidy on the goods will be applied to future importation of the subject goods. In that event, the importer in Canada shall pay all such duties.

The Customs Act applies, with any modifications that the circumstances require, with respect to the accounting and payment of anti-dumping and countervailing duty.

Information
The Statement of Reasons regarding these decisions will be issued within 15 days following the decisions and will be available on the CBSA’s Web site at www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/sima-lmsi or by contacting Manshun Tong at 613-954-1666.

DETERMINATION
Professional, administrative and management support services
Notice is hereby given that, after completing its inquiry, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) made a determination (File No. PR-2014-028) on December 12, 2014, with respect to a complaint filed by Centre de Linguistique Appliquée T.E.S.T. Ltée (T.E.S.T.), of Verdun, Quebec, pursuant to subsection 30.11(1) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 47 (4th Supp.), concerning a procurement (Solicitation No. EN966-140305/D) by the Department of Public Works and Government Services (PWGSC). The solicitation was for translation services.

T.E.S.T. alleged that its bid was incorrectly found non-compliant by reason of an erroneous interpretation by PWGSC of a requirement of the request for supply arrangement and that it did not receive a clear explanation of the reason for which its bid was found non-compliant.

Having examined the evidence presented by the parties and considered the provisions of the Agreement on Government Procurement, the Tribunal determined that the complaint was valid in part.

Further information may be obtained from the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, 333 Laurier Avenue West, 15th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G7, 613-993-3595 (telephone), 613-990-2439 (fax), secretary@citt-tcce.gc.ca (email).
