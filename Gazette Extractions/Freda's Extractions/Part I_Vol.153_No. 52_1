If there are opposing views, each party may file a response no later than January 21, 2020.

Submissions should include concise arguments and supporting evidence concerning

the likelihood of continued or resumed dumping and subsidizing of the goods;

For more information, please see the Tribunal’s Confidentiality Guidelines.

Documents should be filed electronically through the Tribunal’s Secure E-filing Service. Only one electronic copy is required.

Counsel and parties are required to serve their submissions on each other on the same dates they file their submissions. Public submissions are to be served on counsel and those parties who are not represented by counsel. Confidential submissions are to be served only on counsel who have access to the confidential record and who have filed an undertaking with the Tribunal. This information will be included in the list of participants. Submissions that contain information that is confidential to your company/government or your client may be served by electronic means provided you are willing to accept the associated risks. Submissions that contain confidential information belonging to a company/government that is not your own or that is not represented by you must be served by courier. One electronic copy of proof of service must be served on the Tribunal.

The Tribunal will decide by February 5, 2020, on whether an expiry review is warranted. If not warranted, the order will expire on its scheduled expiry date. If the Tribunal decides to initiate an expiry review, it will issue a notice of expiry review.
