CANADA BORDER SERVICES AGENCY
SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT
Certain photovoltaic modules and laminates â€” Decisions
On June 3, 2015, the President of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) made final determinations of dumping and subsidizing pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(a) of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), in respect of photovoltaic modules and laminates consisting of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, including laminates shipped or packaged with other components of photovoltaic modules, and thin film photovoltaic products produced from amorphous silicon (a-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), originating in or exported from the People's Republic of China, excluding modules, laminates or thin film products with a power output not exceeding 100 W; and also excluding modules, laminates or thin film products incorporated into electrical goods where the function of the electrical goods is other than power generation and these electrical goods consume the electricity generated by the photovoltaic product.

The goods in question are usually classified under the following Harmonized System number:

8541.40.00.22
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (Tribunal) is continuing its inquiry into the question of injury to the domestic industry and will make a finding by July 3, 2015. Provisional duties relating to the dumping and subsidizing of the goods will continue to apply until this date on imports of subject goods from the People's Republic of China.

If the Tribunal finds that the dumping and/or subsidizing have caused injury or are threatening to cause injury, anti-dumping duty and/or countervailing duty will be applied to future importation of the subject goods. In that event, the importer in Canada shall pay all such duties.

The Customs Act applies, with any modifications that the circumstances require, with respect to the accounting and payment of anti-dumping and countervailing duty.

Information
The Statement of Reasons regarding these decisions will be issued within 15 days following the decision and will be available on the CBSA Web site at www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/sima-lmsi or by contacting Shawn Ryan at 613-954-7341.
