CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL
INQUIRY
EDP hardware and software
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) has received a complaint (File No. PR-2015-038) from Eclipsys Solutions Inc. (Eclipsys), of Ottawa, Ontario, concerning a procurement by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The solicitation is for the provision of software. Pursuant to subsection 30.13(2) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act and subsection 7(2) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Procurement Inquiry Regulations, notice is hereby given that the Tribunal made a decision on November 6, 2015, to conduct an inquiry into the complaint.

Eclipsys alleges that the CBSA procured new software under the guise of obtaining licences under the terms of an existing supply arrangement contract between the Government of Canada and IBM, which constitutes an illegal sole-source procurement. Eclipsys also alleges that the CBSA's decision-making process was biased.

Further information may be obtained from the Registrar, Canadian International Trade Tribunal Secretariat, 333 Laurier Avenue West, 15th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G7, 613-993-3595 (telephone), 613-990-2439 (fax), citt-tcce@tribunal.gc.ca (email).

CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL
INQUIRY
Information processing and related telecommunications services
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) has received a complaint (File No. PR-2015-039) from Eclipsys Solutions Inc. (Eclipsys), of Ottawa, Ontario, concerning a procurement by Shared Services Canada (SSC) [Solicitation No. 10040747/A]. The solicitation is for data centre server and storage infrastructure services. Pursuant to subsection 30.13(2) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act and subsection 7(2) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Procurement Inquiry Regulations, notice is hereby given that the Tribunal made a decision on November 6, 2015, to conduct an inquiry into the complaint.

Eclipsys alleges that SSC improperly disqualified it from bidding on the basis that it was not a “manufacturer.” Eclipsys also alleges that SSC improperly invoked the national security exception.

Further information may be obtained from the Registrar, Canadian International Trade Tribunal Secretariat, 333 Laurier Avenue West, 15th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G7, 613-993-3595 (telephone), 613-990-2439 (fax), citt-tcce@tribunal.gc.ca (email).
