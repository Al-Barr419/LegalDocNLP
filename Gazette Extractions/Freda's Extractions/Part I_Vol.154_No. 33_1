Notice of intent to develop new regulations under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act with respect to supervised consumption sites and services
This notice of intent provides interested parties and the general public with the opportunity to comment on Health Canada’s intent to develop new regulations under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) with respect to supervised consumption sites and services.

The opioid overdose crisis continues to be one of the most devastating public health crises in recent history. Between January 2016 and December 2019, there have been at least 15 393 apparent opioid-related deaths in Canada. Addressing this crisis requires a comprehensive response that recognizes the complex health and social issues involved in problematic substance use. In recent years, Health Canada has taken steps to integrate harm reduction into the federal response to problematic substance use and the opioid crisis. Harm reduction measures aim to support people who use drugs to live safer and healthier lives and reduce the negative health, social, and economic impacts associated with problematic substance use.

The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that Canada’s response to the current opioid crisis is robust, well-coordinated and effective. Part of this response involves scaling up the most effective harm-reduction programs, such as supervised consumption sites (SCSs). Canadian and international evidence clearly demonstrates that SCSs save lives. SCSs may offer a range of evidence-based harm reduction and treatment services, such as drug checking, peer assistance, and safer supply for medication-assisted therapy. In addition, SCSs serve as a pathway to connect people who use drugs with health and social services, including housing and community services, access to primary health care, and treatment options. Overdose prevention sites, such as supervised consumption sites, provide a space for people who use drugs to consume them and receive overdose response measures if necessary, but they are temporary and do not generally have the additional services offered at an SCS.

The CDSA is the federal drug control statute that protects public health and maintains public safety by generally prohibiting activities with controlled substances (e.g. possession, production, importing, exporting and trafficking), unless authorized through regulations or exemptions. The CDSA is also the means by which Canada fulfills its obligations under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, as amended by the 1972 Protocol; the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971; and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988, which together form the basis for the global drug control system. The objective of regulations under the CDSA is to allow legitimate activities with controlled substances and precursors (for example, their use in approved prescription drugs or research projects), while minimizing the risk of their diversion to illegal markets or uses.

In 2017, the CDSA was amended to, among other things, streamline and simplify the application process for applicants who wish to open an SCS. The application criteria for an SCS were amended to align them with the five factors set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in its 2011 judgment in the case of Canada (Attorney General) v. PHS Community Services Society (i.e. impact on crime rates, local conditions indicating need, regulatory structure in place to support the facility, resources available to support its maintenance, and expressions of community support or opposition).

SCSs are a critical component of the Government of Canada’s approach to addressing the issue of problematic substance use. Current research demonstrates that SCSs reduce the transmission of communicable diseases, decrease infections, reduce emergency room use and hospital admissions related to injection drug use, and decrease overdose deaths.

To operate an SCS for medical purposes in Canada, an exemption under section 56.1 of the CDSA is necessary. Each SCS exemption application is assessed on a case-by-case basis, on its own merits, taking into consideration the information in the application and the public health and public safety objectives of the CDSA. Once an exemption has been granted, applicants are required to undergo a regular subsequent exemption process to continue operating.

As of July 2020, 38 SCSs are operating across the country. Since June 2017, Canadian SCSs have received almost 2.2 million visits, reversed almost 17 400 overdoses without a single death at a site, and made almost 84 000 referrals to health and social services. As the number of SCSs across the country continues to rise, Health Canada is looking to develop new regulations under the CDSA that would seek to

establish supervised consumption sites and services within Canada’s overall harm-reduction framework, consistent with the public health objectives of the CDSA;
establish clear federal regulatory controls, consistent with the public safety objectives of the CDSA;
reduce the overall regulatory burden on SCS applicants and operators; and
provide greater certainty and permanence for SCS operators, better ensuring the continuity of supervised consumption services in Canada.
Health Canada recognizes that there is a wide range of factors that influence the operation of each supervised consumption site, and that new regulations will require flexibility rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. The purpose of this consultation is to seek comments from interested parties that will inform the development of these new regulations for supervised consumption services. In particular, Health Canada is seeking input into the following questions:

(1) What are the impacts of supervised consumption sites or services on people who use drugs, the communities in which these services are located, and the provinces and territories?
(2) What are the main federal regulatory barriers faced by those who are applying to operate or are operating an SCS in Canada? Are there any aspects of either the initial or subsequent process to apply for an exemption under the CDSA that are more burdensome than others?
(3) What types of supervised consumption services (e.g. drug checking, peer assistance, medication-assisted treatment and safer-supply treatment options) should be included under the proposed new regulations? What evidence exists to support the effectiveness of such services?
The publication of this notice of intent in the Canada Gazette, Part I, initiates a 60-day comment period that will end on October 7, 2020. If you are interested in participating in this consultation or would like to provide written comments, please contact the Office of Legislative and Regulatory Affairs, Controlled Substances Directorate, Controlled Substances and Cannabis Branch, Health Canada, by mail at Address Locator: 0302A, 150 Tunney’s Pasture Driveway, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0K9, or by email at hc.csd.regulatory.policy-politique.reglementaire.dsc.sc@canada.ca. All feedback received through this consultation will inform the development of the regulations.
