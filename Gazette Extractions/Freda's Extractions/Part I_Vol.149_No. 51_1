SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT
Certain hot-rolled carbon steel plate and high-strength low-alloy steel plate — Decisions
On December 7, 2015, pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(a) of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) made a final determination of dumping in respect of certain hot-rolled carbon steel plate and high-strength low-alloy steel plate originating in or exported from the Republic of India (India) and the Russian Federation (Russia) and made a final determination of subsidizing in respect of certain hot-rolled carbon steel plate and high-strength low-alloy steel plate originating in or exported from India.

On the same date, pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(b) of SIMA, the CBSA terminated the subsidy investigation in respect of certain hot-rolled carbon steel plate and high-strength low-alloy steel plate originating in or exported from Russia.

The goods in question are usually classified under the following Harmonized System classification numbers:

7208.51.00.10
7208.51.00.91
7208.51.00.92

The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) is continuing its inquiry into the question of injury to the domestic industry and will make a finding by January 6, 2016. Provisional duties relating to dumping of subject goods from India and Russia, and provisional duties relating to the subsidizing of the subject goods from India, will continue to apply until this date. However, the provisional duties relating to the subsidization of goods from Russia will no longer apply, and the provisional duty paid or security posted will be returned.

If the CITT finds that the dumping and/or subsidizing have caused injury or are threatening to cause injury, anti-dumping duty and/or countervailing duty will be applied to future importation of the subject goods. In that event, the importer in Canada shall pay all such duties.

The Customs Act applies, with any modifications that the circumstances require, with respect to the accounting and payment of anti-dumping and countervailing duty.

Information
The Statement of Reasons regarding these decisions will be issued within 15 days following the decisions and will be available on the CBSA Web site at www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/sima-lmsi or by contacting either Mr. Robert Wright at 613-954-1643 or Mr. Matthew Lerette at 613-954-7398.

The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) hereby gives notice that it will, pursuant to subsection 76.03(3) of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), initiate an expiry review (Expiry Review No. RR-2015-002) of its order made on August 15, 2011, in Expiry Review No. RR-2010-001, continuing its order made on August 16, 2006, in Expiry Review No. RR-2005-002, continuing its finding made on August 17, 2001, in Inquiry No. NQ-2001-001, concerning the dumping of flat hot-rolled carbon and alloy steel sheet and strip, including secondary or non-prime material, in various widths from 0.75 in. (19 mm) and wider, and (a) for product in coil form, in thicknesses from 0.054 in. to 0.625 in. (1.37 mm to 15.875 mm) inclusive, and (b) for product that is cut to length, in thicknesses from 0.054 in. up to but not including 0.187 in.

The order is scheduled to expire on August 14, 2016.

In this expiry review, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will first determine whether the expiry of the order in respect of the subject goods is likely to result in the continuation or resumption of dumping and subsidizing of the subject goods. If the CBSA determines that the expiry of the order in respect of any goods is likely to result in the continuation or resumption of dumping and subsidizing, the Tribunal will then conduct an expiry review to determine if the continued or resumed dumping and subsidizing is likely to result in injury. The CBSA must provide notice of its determinations within 120 days after receiving notice of the Tribunal's decision to initiate an expiry review, that is, no later than April 6, 2016. The Tribunal will issue its order no later than August 12, 2016, and its statement of reasons no later than August 26, 2016.

Each person or government wishing to participate in this expiry review must file a notice of participation with the Tribunal on or before April 21, 2016.

The schedule for this expiry review is found at www.citt-tcce.gc.ca.

The Tribunal will hold a public hearing relating to this expiry review in the Tribunal's Hearing Room No. 1, 18th Floor, 333 Laurier Avenue West, Ottawa, Ontario, commencing on June 27, 2016, at 9:30 a.m., to hear evidence and representations by interested parties.

In accordance with section 46 of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, a person who provides information to the Tribunal and who wishes some or all of the information to be kept confidential must, among other things, submit a non-confidential edited version or summary of the information designated as confidential, or a statement indicating why such a summary cannot be made.
