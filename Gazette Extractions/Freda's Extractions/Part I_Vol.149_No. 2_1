CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL
DETERMINATION
Professional, administrative and management support services
Notice is hereby given that, after completing its inquiry, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) made a determination (File No. PR-2014-033) on December 22, 2014, with respect to a complaint filed by COTRACO Ltd. (COTRACO), of Orléans, Ontario, pursuant to subsection 30.11(1) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 47 (4th Supp.), concerning a procurement (Solicitation No. EN966-140305/D) by the Department of Public Works and Government Services (PWGSC). The solicitation was for translation services.

COTRACO alleged that its bid had been improperly declared non-compliant with regard to certain aspects, due to PWGSC’s erroneous interpretation of a requirement in the Request for a Supply Arrangement, and that various other irregularities had tainted this process for a supply arrangement.

Having examined the evidence presented by the parties and considered the provisions of the Agreement on Internal Trade, the Tribunal determined that the complaint was not valid.

Further information may be obtained from the Registrar, Canadian International Trade Tribunal, 333 Laurier Avenue West, 15th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G7, 613-993-3595 (telephone), 613-990-2439 (fax), citt-tcce@tribunal.gc.ca (email).
