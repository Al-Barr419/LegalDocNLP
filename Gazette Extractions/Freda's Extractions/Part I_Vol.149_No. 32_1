CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL
DETERMINATION
Health and social services
Notice is hereby given that, after completing its inquiry, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) made a determination (File No. PR-2015-004) on July 27, 2015, with respect to a complaint filed by Workplace Medical Corp. (Workplace Medical), of Hamilton, Ontario, pursuant to subsection 30.11(1) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 47 (4th Supp.), concerning a procurement (Solicitation No. K0305) by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The solicitation was for the provision of occupational health services.

Workplace Medical alleged that the CFIA included unnecessarily restrictive specifications in the solicitation, used undisclosed criteria in evaluating Workplace Medical's bid, applied evaluation criteria inconsistently or mistakenly and had improper contact with the incumbent bidder during the procurement process.

Having examined the evidence presented by the parties, the Tribunal determined that the complaint was not valid.

Further information may be obtained from the Registrar, Canadian International Trade Tribunal Secretariat, 333 Laurier Avenue West, 15th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G7, 613-993-3595 (telephone), 613-990-2439 (fax), citt-tcce@tribunal.gc.ca (email).
