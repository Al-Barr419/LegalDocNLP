CANADA BORDER SERVICES AGENCY
SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT
Certain carbon and alloy steel line pipe — Decisions
On November 26, 2015, pursuant to subsection 38(1) of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) made preliminary determinations of dumping and subsidizing in respect of certain carbon and alloy steel line pipe originating in or exported from the People's Republic of China.

The goods in question are usually classified under the following Harmonized System numbers:

7304.19.00.11
7304.19.00.12
7304.19.00.21
7304.19.00.22

7305.19.00.11
7305.19.00.19
7306.19.00.10
7306.19.00.90
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal (Tribunal) will conduct a full inquiry into the question of injury to the Canadian industry and will make an order or finding not later than 120 days after its receipt of the notice of the preliminary determination of dumping and subsidizing.

Pursuant to section 8 of SIMA, provisional duty is payable on subject goods that are released from the CBSA during the period commencing November 26, 2015, and ending on the earlier of the day the investigations are terminated, the day on which the Tribunal makes an order or finding, or the day an undertaking is accepted.

The amount of provisional duty payable is not greater than the estimated margin of dumping and the estimated amount of subsidy. The Customs Act applies with respect to the accounting and payment of provisional duty. Consequently, failure to pay duties within the prescribed time will result in the application of the interest provisions of the Customs Act.

Information
The Statement of Reasons regarding these decisions will be issued within 15 days following the decisions and will be available on the CBSA Web site at www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/sima-lmsi or by contacting either Mr. Jody Grantham at 613-954-7405 or Mr. Shawn Ryan at 416-952-0114.

Notice was received by the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) on November 26, 2015, from the Director General of the Trade and Anti-dumping Programs Directorate at the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), stating that preliminary determinations had been made respecting the dumping and subsidizing of carbon and alloy steel line pipe originating in or exported from the People's Republic of China.

In this inquiry, the subject goods are defined as

carbon and alloy steel line pipe originating in or exported from the People's Republic of China, welded or seamless, having an outside diameter from 2.375 inches (60.3 mm) up to and including 24 inches (609.6 mm), including line pipe meeting or supplied to meet any one or several of API 5L, CSA Z245.1, ISO 3183, ASTM A333, ASTM A106, ASTM A53-B or their equivalents, in all grades, whether or not meeting specifications for other end uses (e.g. single-, dual-, or multiple-certified, for use in oil and gas, piling pipe, or other applications), and regardless of end finish (plain ends, beveled ends, threaded ends, or threaded and coupled ends), surface finish (coated or uncoated), wall thickness, or length, excluding galvanized line pipe and excluding stainless steel line pipe (containing 10.5 percent or more by weight of chromium), excluding goods covered by the Tribunal's finding in Inquiry No. NQ-2012-002 and goods covered by the Tribunal's order in Expiry Review No. RR-2012-003.

Pursuant to section 42 of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), the Tribunal has initiated an inquiry (Inquiry No. NQ-2015-002) to determine whether the dumping and subsidizing of the above-mentioned goods have caused injury or retardation or are threatening to cause injury, and to determine such other matters as the Tribunal is required to determine under that section.

Each person or government wishing to participate in the inquiry and at the hearing as a party must file a notice of participation with the Tribunal on or before December 11, 2015. Each counsel who intends to represent a party in the inquiry and at the hearing must file a notice of representation, as well as a declaration and undertaking, with the Tribunal on or before December 11, 2015.

A public hearing relating to this inquiry will be held in the Tribunal's Hearing Room No. 1, 18th Floor, 333 Laurier Avenue West, Ottawa, Ontario, commencing on February 22, 2016, at 9:30 a.m., to hear evidence and representations by interested parties.

In accordance with section 46 of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, a person who provides information to the Tribunal and who wishes some or all of the information to be kept confidential must submit to the Tribunal, at the time the information is provided, a statement designating the information as confidential, together with an explanation as to why that information is designated as confidential. Furthermore, the person must submit a non-confidential summary of the information designated as confidential or a statement indicating why such a summary cannot be made.

Written submissions, correspondence and requests for information regarding this notice should be addressed to the Registrar, Canadian International Trade Tribunal Secretariat, 333 Laurier Avenue West, 15th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G7, 613-993-3595 (telephone), 613-990-2439 (fax), citt-tcce@tribunal.gc.ca (email).

CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL
DETERMINATION
Marine
Notice is hereby given that, after completing its inquiry, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) made a determination (File No. PR-2015-021) on November 23, 2015, with respect to a complaint filed by Méridien Maritime Réparation (Méridien), of Matane, Quebec, pursuant to subsection 30.11(1) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 47 (4th Supp.), concerning a procurement (Solicitation No. F7047-141000/C) by the Department of Public Works and Government Services (PWGSC) on behalf of the Canadian Coast Guard, Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The solicitation was for search and rescue lifeboats.

Méridien alleged that PWGSC failed to properly evaluate Méridien's bid, ignored vital information contained in the bid and failed to conduct the evaluation in a procedurally fair manner.

Having examined the evidence presented by the parties and considered the provisions of the Agreement on Internal Trade, the Tribunal determined that the complaint was not valid.

Further information may be obtained from the Registrar, Canadian International Trade Tribunal Secretariat, 333 Laurier Avenue West, 15th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G7, 613-993-3595 (telephone), 613-990-2439 (fax), citt-tcce@tribunal.gc.ca (email).

Supercalendered paper from Canada
Notice is hereby given, in accordance with the Special Import Measures Act (as amended by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act), that on November 18, 2015, a Request for Panel Review of the Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination made by the United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, respecting “Supercalendered Paper from Canada,” was filed by counsel for Irving Paper Limited. Additional requests were also filed with the United States Section of the NAFTA Secretariat, pursuant to Article 1904 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, on behalf of the Government of Canada and the governments of the provinces of Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and New Brunswick as well as Resolute FP Canada Inc. and Resolute FP U.S. Inc. and Port Hawkesbury Paper LP.

The Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination was published in the Federal Register, on October 20, 2015 [80 Fed. Reg. 63535].

The panel review will be conducted in accordance with the NAFTA Article 1904 Panel Rules. Subrule 35(1)(c) of the above-mentioned rules provides that

(i) a Party or interested person may challenge the final determination in whole or in part by filing a Complaint in accordance with rule 39 within 30 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review [the deadline for filing a Complaint is December 18, 2015];
(ii) a Party, an investigating authority or other interested person who does not file a Complaint but who intends to participate in the panel review shall file a Notice of Appearance in accordance with rule 40 within 45 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review [the deadline for filing a Notice of Appearance is January 4, 2016]; and
(iii) the panel review will be limited to the allegations of error of fact or law, including challenges to the jurisdiction of the investigating authority, that are set out in the Complaints filed in the panel review and to the procedural and substantive defenses raised in the panel review.
Notices of Appearance and Complaints pertaining to the present panel review, USA-CDA-2015-1904-01, should be filed with the United States Secretary at the NAFTA Secretariat, U.S. Section, North American Free Trade Agreement, Commerce Building, Suite 2061, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, United States.

Explanatory note
Chapter 19 of the North American Free Trade Agreement establishes a procedure for replacing domestic judicial review of determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty panel reviews involving imports from a NAFTA country with review by binational panels.

These panels are established, when a Request for Panel Review is received by the NAFTA Secretariat, to act in place of national courts to review final determinations expeditiously to determine whether they are in accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.

Under Article 1904 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1994, the Government of Canada, the Government of the United States and the Government of Mexico established the Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews. These rules were published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on January 1, 1994.

Requests for information concerning the present notice, or concerning the NAFTA Article 1904 Panel Rules, should be addressed to the Canadian Secretary, NAFTA Secretariat, Canadian Section, 111 Sussex Drive, 5th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 1J1, 343-203-4269.
