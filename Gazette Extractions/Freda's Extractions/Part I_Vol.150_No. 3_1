Explanatory note
Chapter 19 of the North American Free Trade Agreement establishes a procedure for replacing domestic judicial review of determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty panel reviews involving imports from a NAFTA country with review by binational panels.

These panels are established, when a Request for Panel Review is received by the NAFTA Secretariat, to act in place of national courts to review final determinations expeditiously to determine whether they are in accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.

Under Article 1904 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1994, the Government of Canada, the Government of the United States and the Government of Mexico established the Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews. These rules were published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on January 1, 1994.

Requests for information concerning the present notice, or concerning the NAFTA Article 1904 Panel Rules, should be addressed to the Canadian Secretary, NAFTA Secretariat, Canadian Section, North American Free Trade Agreement, 111 Sussex Drive, 5th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G2, 343-203-4269.
