CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL
DETERMINATION
Professional, administrative and management support services
Notice is hereby given that, after completing its inquiry, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) made a determination (File No. PR-2015-002) on July 16, 2015, with respect to a complaint filed by Samson & Associates (Samson), of Gatineau, Quebec, pursuant to subsection 30.11(1) of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 47 (4th Supp.), concerning a procurement (Solicitation No. EN929-150929/A) by the Department of Public Works and Government Services (PWGSC). The solicitation was for the provision of internal audit services.

Samson alleged that PWGSC used undisclosed criteria in evaluating Samson's bid and improperly concluded that certain project experience listed by Samson did not meet the requirements of the Request for Proposal.

Having examined the evidence presented by the parties and considered the provisions of the Agreement on Internal Trade, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Agreement on Government Procurement, the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement, the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement, the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, the Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement and the Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement, the Tribunal determined that the complaint was not valid.

Further information may be obtained from the Registrar, Canadian International Trade Tribunal Secretariat, 333 Laurier Avenue West, 15th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G7, 613-993-3595 (telephone), 613-990-2439 (fax), citt-tcce@tribunal.gc.ca (email).
