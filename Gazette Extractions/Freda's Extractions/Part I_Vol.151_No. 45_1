Notice to interested parties â€” Removal of some of the regulatory restrictions specific to diacetylmorphine (heroin) in the Narcotic Control Regulations
This notice provides interested stakeholders with the opportunity to provide comments on Health Canada's intent to remove some of the regulatory restrictions in the Narcotic Control Regulations (NCR) specific to diacetylmorphine (heroin). These restrictions may pose barriers for access to diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment. Diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment is a recognized treatment option for a small percentage of patients with opioid dependence who have not responded to other treatments.

Diacetylmorphine is controlled under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and activities with this substance are regulated under the NCR. Diacetylmorphine is also a drug whose sale is regulated under the Food and Drugs Act and the Food and Drug Regulations.

Unlike other opioids, diacetylmorphine is subject to additional specific regulatory controls that have the effect of restricting its administration to hospital settings only. The NCR only authorize licensed dealers to sell or provide diacetylmorphine to a pharmacist if they are a hospital employee or are exempt under section 56 of the CDSA with respect to its possession. The NCR also prohibit practitioners of medicine or dentistry from prescribing diacetylmorphine, and from administering it unless the person is an in-patient or outpatient of a hospital.

These regulatory constraints on diacetylmorphine pose additional barriers for access to diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment. For example, patients may have to go to a hospital, possibly several times per day, to receive their treatment. Evidence indicates that any barrier to accessing treatment can deter patients suffering from opioid use disorder, and that providing quick, non-judgmental services where they are most needed is one key to success.

The proposed changes would increase opportunities for diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that includes related services such as primary health care and counselling. It is important to note that diacetylmorphine would continue to be subject to controls set out in the CDSA.

In light of the opioid crisis in Canada, Health Canada is committed to supporting better treatment options by facilitating access to treatments for opioid use disorder. Comments on whether Health Canada should remove these regulatory requirements in the NCR in order to facilitate access to diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment are encouraged.

The publication of this notice in the Canada Gazette, Part I, initiates a 60-day comment period. Anyone interested in this process or who has comments on this notice should contact Legislative and Regulatory Affairs, Controlled Substances Directorate, Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, by mail at Address Locator: 0302A, 150 Tunney's Pasture Driveway, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0K9, or by email at ocs_regulatorypolicy-bsc_politiquereglementaire@hc-sc.gc.ca.
